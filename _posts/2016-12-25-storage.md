#### Week 9: Storage > 9.1 The need for storage > Lecture



why energy storage is needed in a future with renewable energies.



wind and soloar pattern can be substituted each other.


On the shortest time scale of say 15 minutes we are dealing for instance with changes of solar irradiance due to clouds; then there is the day and night cycle which is mainly affected by the power generated by solar PV panels; 

weather spells may affect the sustainable energy production for several days and last but not least the effect of the change of seasons on the production will last for several months.


If we look at the day and night cycle (in white and grey), we observe a similar pattern: while the wind power is generally higher during the night, in general, it will be not enough to compensate for the lack of solar energy during the night.

Only when the installed wind power is much larger than the installed solar power, such a compensation could be feasible.

The fluctuations in production of sustainable energy have a strong effect on the price of electricity.

As a result, the price of electricity fluctuates enormously. 

Note that the electricity price may even attain negative values (as shown here for the German market).

Besides the fluctuations in the production of sustainable energy, we also have to consider the variability of electricity demand.


Roughly the same time scales come into play. Here, we only consider the two most important ones.


Of course there is the day- ‐night rhythm of human activities, where the energy consumption fluctuates for example with the use of electrical lighting and other home appliances.


On the other hand, seasonal changes have an enormous impact on the amount of energy we use for heating and cooling purposes.
In the conventional power systems these fluctuations are dealt with by powering up or down the utility plants.


In a sustainable energy system this is not so simple. It would be a waste to dump the overproduction of electrical energy. Hence, we have to search for means to store it.

Basically, we have three solutions for the mismatch between sustainable energy production and use.


 - First of all, we may think of a system to adapt demand to the availability of energy in a so called smart grid.

 - Another possibility is to make a large energy network connecting Europe and Northern Africa.

While the north of Europe has the most wind power, the south would provide us with solar power.

Connecting them over large distances and adding geothermal power sources could reduce some of the mismatch between energy production and use.

 - The third solution is the introduction of energy storage .
Which of the three solutions will become dominant is hard to predict and depends strongly on their cost effectiveness.

#### Week 9: Storage > 9.2 Forms of storage > Lecture

the different forms of energy storage will be introduced. These are mechanical storage, heat storage, electrical storage and chemical storage.


##### Inverted Lake

The inverted lake is a form of mechanical storage, similar to a hydro pumped storage plant in the mountains or to a dam.


the design of the inverted lake by Lievense, as shown in the lecture, be improved to have a higher storage capacity

The generator should move along with the surface of the inner lake.

Usually, the generator is located at the maximum level of the inner lake, when it is completely filled. However, if the generator could be at a lower level during the initial filling, more potential energy can be gained. And if the generator can move up from the maximum level, the lake can be filled further, increasing its capacity.

##### Compressed Air Storage
Assume Germany would want to store this energy using the compressed air storage system, shown in the image below.
For the following question the following equations are given:

Ideal gas law

pV=nRT=constant

Where p is pressure (in Pa), V is volume (in m3), n is amount of gas (in moles), R is the gas constant (8.3144598 JK-1mole-1) and T is the temperature (K).


Compression of an ideal gas at constant temperature:
The work involved when a gas is compressed from volume A to volume B is calculated from the integral of the pressure isotherm over the volume difference between state A and B.

$$W_{A{\rightarrow}B}=\int\limits_{V_A}^{V_B}pdV$$

Then we can use the ideal gas law to rewrite p and solve the integral:

$$W_{A{\rightarrow}B}=\int\limits_{V_A}^{V_B}\frac{nRT}{V}dV=nRT\int\limits_{V_A}^{V_B}\frac{1}{V}dV=nRT(\ln{V_B}-\ln{V_A})$$



Rewriting gives:

$$W_{A{\rightarrow}B}=nRT(\ln{V_B}-\ln{V_A})=nRT\ln\frac{V_B}{V_A}=nRT\ln\frac{p_A}{p_B}={p_A}{V_A}\ln\frac{p_A}{p_B}$$

Where p is pressure (in Pa), V is volume (in m3), and W is the energy (in J).

###### Volume needed for storage


How much volume would be needed to store the excess energy in a compressed air chamber, assuming reversible ideal gas compression? Assume the pressure in the salt cavern is 100 bar.
Have a look at the equations in the description above. Please give the answer in cubic meters. Note that 1 bar is equal to 105 Pa. Use only one significant digit and use scientific notation (for example, if the answer would be 123456, you can either write '1E5' or '1*10^5').

$$W={p_B}{V_B}\ln\frac{p_A}{p_B}\rightarrow {V_B}=\frac{-W}{p_B}\ln\frac{p_B}{p_A}=\frac{4.32\cdot10^{14} J}{10^{7} Pa}\ln\frac{10^{7} Pa}{10^{5} Pa}=2\cdot10^{8} m^{3}$$

##### Week 9: Storage > 9.3 Electrical storage 


the advantage of batteries compared to other forms of energy storage?


The efficiency of the charging and discharging cycle is very high.

----------
For the next question, we will calculate the specific energy (energy per weight) of the battery of a mobile phone. We will first calculate this for an example, given below, and afterwards you can compare this example to your own phone battery.


the energy density of the mobile phone battery above in J/kg.

The energy of the phone battery is calculated first: 2.1Ah⋅3.7V=7.8Wh

Then convert the energy to J, where 1Wh=3600J→7.8Wh=28⋅103J

The energy density is simply the energy in J divided by the weight of the phone in kg: 28⋅103J/0.040kg=70⋅104J/kg

#### Week 9: Storage > 9.4 Chemical storage - Hydrogen > Lecture 1

the simplest molecule that we can store energy in: hydrogen

Hydrogen has a high energy per weight, but its main problem is its low energy per volume.

hydrogen as a form of chemical storage. It explains how hydrogen is produced and how it can be used as a fuel, specifically in a fuel cell.

##### Hydrogen tank in a car
the energy density of hydrogen in a 700 bar tank is 5 MJ/kg. We want to use this type of tank for a hydrogen fuelled car. Calculate the weight of the tank (in kg) that is needed for such a car.

Use the following information:

- The car has a driving range of 500 km.

- The car needs 10 kWh/100km electrical energy.

- The fuel cell in the car has an efficiency of 60%.


Explanation
Required energy for a driving range of 500 km: 10kWh/100km⋅500km=50kWh=50⋅103⋅3600J=18⋅107J

Required energy of the fuel: 1/0.6⋅18⋅107J=30⋅107J=300MJ
Weight of full tank: 300MJ/5MJ/kg=60kg


##### Weight of the hydrogen fuel


In the previous question you have calculated the weight of the tank. Now, we want to calculate the weight of the hydrogen itself.

In Lecture 1 (slide 4) we saw that the energy density of hydrogen gas is around 140 MJ/kg. The energy density of the hydrogen in a 700 bar tank is 5 MJ/kg.

What is the weight of the hydrogen in the tank (in kg)?.

Explanation
Energy of the hydrogen: 5MJ/kg⋅60kg=300MJ
Weight of hydrogen in the tank: 300MJ140MJ/kg=2.1kg


##### Producing the hydrogen


The hydrogen for the car is produced by electrolysis. The electrolysis takes place at a voltage of 2V. The Gibbs free energy of hydrogen is 143 MJ/kg.

How much electricity is needed to produce the hydrogen of one full tank (in kWh)?

Explanation
The efficiency of the electrolysis: 1.23V/2V=0.615=61.5%
Energy needed to produce hydrogen: 143MJ/kg/0.615⋅2.1kg=488MJ=4883.6kWh=136kWh

##### Cycle efficiency


The efficiency of the fuel cell in the car is 50%.

What is the efficiency of the whole cycle, from the electricity to the energy used by the car?
 
 Explanation
The efficiency of the hydrogen production with electrolysis: 1.23V/2V=0.615
The total efficiency of hydrogen production and hydrogen consumption: 0.615⋅0.5=0.31=31%


##### Week 9: Storage > 9.5 Chemical storage - Solar fuels > Lecture


There are more forms of chemical storage besides hydrogen. Most of these can be made through CO2 reduction. 

The sun can be used as energy input for the production of these compounds, which is why they are called solar fuels.


the 'volatility' of different forms of energy storage was briefly mentioned. Batteries are volatile, because they discharge slowly over time, even if they are not used.


###### The need for solar fuels

a lot of research is still needed to develop ways to produce solar fuels. There are several reasons why money is invested in this research.


a) Solar fuels are needed as a resource for the chemical industry.

b) Solar fuels have a worse cycle efficiency than other forms of energy storage.

c) Solar fuels are non-volatile.

Nine Updates on China’s 2016 Energy Storage Industry

In the first half of this year we observed some positive signs: China’s increasing electricity system reforms, the rise of the “energy internet,” and growing activity in frequency regulation and peak-load shifting in China’s North. We also saw some less positive developments such as increases in wind and solar curtailments. Good and bad alike, all of these developments underline the importance of energy storage in a wide array of fields, from renewable energy, distributed generation and microgrids, as well as in setting electricity prices.  From the beginning of 2016 to present, China’s energy storage industry took steps forward in project planning, policy support, and increasing product capacity.

ZHANGBEI, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–BYD and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) have finished construction on what may be the world’s largest battery energy storage station. This large utility-scale project, located in Zhangbei, Hebei Province, combines 140 Mega-Watts of renewable energy generation (both wind & solar), 36 Mega-Watt-Hours (MWh) of energy storage and a smart power transmission system. While there are renewable generation systems of this scale in service today, there are no battery systems of this size. The State Grid system is demonstrating a stable solution for transferring vast amounts of renewable electricity safely to the grid on an unprecedented scale. Although BYD manufactures 1GW of solar panels annually, their role in this project was primarily providing energy storage batteries in arrays larger than a football field.

SGCC chose BYD’s Iron-Phosphate battery technology because of its superior service life (over 20 years) and also used BYD’s “peak shaving & load leveling” charge and discharge methodologies. BYD’s announcement September 30th, 2011, “China’s Largest and First Environmentally-friendly Battery Storage Station,” was the first of many MegaWatt-level cooperative projects with China’s Southern Power Grid (CSG). This new project with the State Grid has outpaced other grid projects in China and, though independently designed by SGCC, is part of the national “Golden Sun” program. The first phase investment with 100MW of Wind, 40MW of Solar and 36MWh of Battery is worth over $500M USD (~3.3 Billion RMB).

“The large-scale implementation of clean and green energy, such as wind and solar power, can only be realized when the technical difficulties of this new energy application in the utility system are resolved,” said Xiu Binglin, Deputy Director of the National Energy Administration. “This State Grid project demonstrates a solution and will be the model of development for China’s new energy resources.”

The US has about 80,000 existing dams. Roughly 2,500 are used for electricity generation. Based on a survey of dams on federal lands at least 10% should be useable for PuHS. The requirements are 1) adequate head (water height), 2) close to transmission lines, and 3) room for a small catchment pond below the dam.

The water used for PuHS is not sent downstream. It's released into a catchment basin as power is produced and then pumped back behind the dam when there is energy to be stored.

Even in dry areas PuHS can be used. Most have rainy seasons. A company in Utah has developed plans to build at least three PuHS facilities in the state. They've calculated that they can use an acceptable amount of the rainy season runoff and fill their reservoirs over a three year span. After that replacing the ~10% loss to evaporation would not be a problem.

As the climate changes some places will likely become dryer. In those places we may not be able to use PuHS. But other places will receive more precipitation. Warmer air means higher evaporation (the oceans are huge) and that higher moisture comes down when warm moist air hits cooler air. We're experiencing a rising rate of rain bombs.



![Markdown](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e64e18af3c52bf7d6560e0654bc2646356308d0a6a72e4d89e7475657622fb44.png).



Even power producing dams can be converted to PuHS. Replace the turbines with pump/turbines and pump water back behind the dam when there's no demand for the dam's output. What we do now is just to stop operation.

Evaporation is not going to be impacted in any meaningful way. Surface area will be modestly increased in those places where a new catchment area would be needed.

Then there are "turkey nests". PuHS facilities build on table lands or in hills close to the ocean. They use a shallow upper reservoir which is lined and the lower reservoir is the ocean.

Natural gas works great as a wind/solar fill in. But there are a couple of problems with it. First, burning NG adds more carbon to the atmosphere and drives climate change faster. Second, we will run out of NG.


-----------------------------------------------
I don't think the CCNG plants will become peakers, medium-long term. We're likely to start installing 'one day' storage as we install more wind and solar. That storage will do the 'peaking'. CCNG plants will drop back into backup roles, turning on when batteries are starting to be depleted and little wind/solar input expected.

Then we'll install enough storage to cover 2-3 days and CCNG's role will further shrink. But overall I expect that gas plants will turned on and left on for several hours to days at a time. Batteries will store any extra output and then do the demand/supply matching.

-----
CCGT are both baseload now and peakers as can vary efficiently to 50% power following the load at 40% of the fuel, pollution, cost of SCGT.
Any need big grids had for batteries was made moot by these NG CCGTs.
'Storage' instead will be viable loads, generation, DG batteries, EVs, pumped storage, making batteries, metal, etc loads and supplies.
PowerPacks cost around $.20/kwhr plus the cost of electricity to charge them and when utilities can buy power all day, night long under $.06/kwhr at most, there is no need for them in big grids.
Now retail as their price drops to $.10/kwhr retail makes offgrid DG power so cheap leaving the grid saves 50% now in many cases as RE prices drop, 75% cheaper.

--------

Utilities are installing PowerPacks anyway for frequency regulation, since batteries are the only thing fast enough for really good frequency regulation, except capacitors which are much too expensive.

Utilities are overbuilding the frequency regulation installs.

Think about what that means. The utilities will promptly use those installs to deal with short-term peaks (of seconds or minutes) as well.



In general it takes 10 to 15 minutes to bring the gas turbine up to full speed in a CCNG plant. And then 3 to 4 hours to heat up the steam turbine portion of the gas plant. IIRC
