Nine Updates on China’s 2016 Energy Storage Industry

In the first half of this year we observed some positive signs: China’s increasing electricity system reforms, the rise of the “energy internet,” and growing activity in frequency regulation and peak-load shifting in China’s North. We also saw some less positive developments such as increases in wind and solar curtailments. Good and bad alike, all of these developments underline the importance of energy storage in a wide array of fields, from renewable energy, distributed generation and microgrids, as well as in setting electricity prices.  From the beginning of 2016 to present, China’s energy storage industry took steps forward in project planning, policy support, and increasing product capacity.

ZHANGBEI, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–BYD and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) have finished construction on what may be the world’s largest battery energy storage station. This large utility-scale project, located in Zhangbei, Hebei Province, combines 140 Mega-Watts of renewable energy generation (both wind & solar), 36 Mega-Watt-Hours (MWh) of energy storage and a smart power transmission system. While there are renewable generation systems of this scale in service today, there are no battery systems of this size. The State Grid system is demonstrating a stable solution for transferring vast amounts of renewable electricity safely to the grid on an unprecedented scale. Although BYD manufactures 1GW of solar panels annually, their role in this project was primarily providing energy storage batteries in arrays larger than a football field.

SGCC chose BYD’s Iron-Phosphate battery technology because of its superior service life (over 20 years) and also used BYD’s “peak shaving & load leveling” charge and discharge methodologies. BYD’s announcement September 30th, 2011, “China’s Largest and First Environmentally-friendly Battery Storage Station,” was the first of many MegaWatt-level cooperative projects with China’s Southern Power Grid (CSG). This new project with the State Grid has outpaced other grid projects in China and, though independently designed by SGCC, is part of the national “Golden Sun” program. The first phase investment with 100MW of Wind, 40MW of Solar and 36MWh of Battery is worth over $500M USD (~3.3 Billion RMB).

“The large-scale implementation of clean and green energy, such as wind and solar power, can only be realized when the technical difficulties of this new energy application in the utility system are resolved,” said Xiu Binglin, Deputy Director of the National Energy Administration. “This State Grid project demonstrates a solution and will be the model of development for China’s new energy resources.”
