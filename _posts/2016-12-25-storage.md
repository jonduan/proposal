Nine Updates on China’s 2016 Energy Storage Industry

In the first half of this year we observed some positive signs: China’s increasing electricity system reforms, the rise of the “energy internet,” and growing activity in frequency regulation and peak-load shifting in China’s North. We also saw some less positive developments such as increases in wind and solar curtailments. Good and bad alike, all of these developments underline the importance of energy storage in a wide array of fields, from renewable energy, distributed generation and microgrids, as well as in setting electricity prices.  From the beginning of 2016 to present, China’s energy storage industry took steps forward in project planning, policy support, and increasing product capacity.

ZHANGBEI, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–BYD and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) have finished construction on what may be the world’s largest battery energy storage station. This large utility-scale project, located in Zhangbei, Hebei Province, combines 140 Mega-Watts of renewable energy generation (both wind & solar), 36 Mega-Watt-Hours (MWh) of energy storage and a smart power transmission system. While there are renewable generation systems of this scale in service today, there are no battery systems of this size. The State Grid system is demonstrating a stable solution for transferring vast amounts of renewable electricity safely to the grid on an unprecedented scale. Although BYD manufactures 1GW of solar panels annually, their role in this project was primarily providing energy storage batteries in arrays larger than a football field.

SGCC chose BYD’s Iron-Phosphate battery technology because of its superior service life (over 20 years) and also used BYD’s “peak shaving & load leveling” charge and discharge methodologies. BYD’s announcement September 30th, 2011, “China’s Largest and First Environmentally-friendly Battery Storage Station,” was the first of many MegaWatt-level cooperative projects with China’s Southern Power Grid (CSG). This new project with the State Grid has outpaced other grid projects in China and, though independently designed by SGCC, is part of the national “Golden Sun” program. The first phase investment with 100MW of Wind, 40MW of Solar and 36MWh of Battery is worth over $500M USD (~3.3 Billion RMB).

“The large-scale implementation of clean and green energy, such as wind and solar power, can only be realized when the technical difficulties of this new energy application in the utility system are resolved,” said Xiu Binglin, Deputy Director of the National Energy Administration. “This State Grid project demonstrates a solution and will be the model of development for China’s new energy resources.”

The US has about 80,000 existing dams. Roughly 2,500 are used for electricity generation. Based on a survey of dams on federal lands at least 10% should be useable for PuHS. The requirements are 1) adequate head (water height), 2) close to transmission lines, and 3) room for a small catchment pond below the dam.

The water used for PuHS is not sent downstream. It's released into a catchment basin as power is produced and then pumped back behind the dam when there is energy to be stored.

Even in dry areas PuHS can be used. Most have rainy seasons. A company in Utah has developed plans to build at least three PuHS facilities in the state. They've calculated that they can use an acceptable amount of the rainy season runoff and fill their reservoirs over a three year span. After that replacing the ~10% loss to evaporation would not be a problem.

As the climate changes some places will likely become dryer. In those places we may not be able to use PuHS. But other places will receive more precipitation. Warmer air means higher evaporation (the oceans are huge) and that higher moisture comes down when warm moist air hits cooler air. We're experiencing a rising rate of rain bombs.

Even power producing dams can be converted to PuHS. Replace the turbines with pump/turbines and pump water back behind the dam when there's no demand for the dam's output. What we do now is just to stop operation.

Evaporation is not going to be impacted in any meaningful way. Surface area will be modestly increased in those places where a new catchment area would be needed.

Then there are "turkey nests". PuHS facilities build on table lands or in hills close to the ocean. They use a shallow upper reservoir which is lined and the lower reservoir is the ocean.

Natural gas works great as a wind/solar fill in. But there are a couple of problems with it. First, burning NG adds more carbon to the atmosphere and drives climate change faster. Second, we will run out of NG.


-----------------------------------------------
I don't think the CCNG plants will become peakers, medium-long term. We're likely to start installing 'one day' storage as we install more wind and solar. That storage will do the 'peaking'. CCNG plants will drop back into backup roles, turning on when batteries are starting to be depleted and little wind/solar input expected.

Then we'll install enough storage to cover 2-3 days and CCNG's role will further shrink. But overall I expect that gas plants will turned on and left on for several hours to days at a time. Batteries will store any extra output and then do the demand/supply matching.

-----
CCGT are both baseload now and peakers as can vary efficiently to 50% power following the load at 40% of the fuel, pollution, cost of SCGT.
Any need big grids had for batteries was made moot by these NG CCGTs.
'Storage' instead will be viable loads, generation, DG batteries, EVs, pumped storage, making batteries, metal, etc loads and supplies.
PowerPacks cost around $.20/kwhr plus the cost of electricity to charge them and when utilities can buy power all day, night long under $.06/kwhr at most, there is no need for them in big grids.
Now retail as their price drops to $.10/kwhr retail makes offgrid DG power so cheap leaving the grid saves 50% now in many cases as RE prices drop, 75% cheaper.

--------

Utilities are installing PowerPacks anyway for frequency regulation, since batteries are the only thing fast enough for really good frequency regulation, except capacitors which are much too expensive.

Utilities are overbuilding the frequency regulation installs.

Think about what that means. The utilities will promptly use those installs to deal with short-term peaks (of seconds or minutes) as well.



In general it takes 10 to 15 minutes to bring the gas turbine up to full speed in a CCNG plant. And then 3 to 4 hours to heat up the steam turbine portion of the gas plant. IIRC


----

LCOE does not capture the cost of backing up renewables when they aren't producing, or reflect their net cost - which increases at higher penetration levels. In Texas/ERCOT today, wind without subsidies does not pencil out because it crushes market prices during the very hours that wind produces at its highest levels. The same is true for solar in California.

A wind/solar PPA at $40/MWh or even $20/MWh sounds good, but not if you could have instead purchased power during those hours for $10/MWh or even seen negative prices and are forced to pay the wholesale market to take your surplus power (or curtail output). On Christmas day it looks like about 4000 MW of wind power was economically curtailed in ERCOT during the early morning hours when energy market prices fell to < $1/MWh.

------
Nuclear is about 90%. Coal has an availability of about 85% but we use is less.

Thing is, there is no way to predict when a thermal plant will suddenly go offline. That means that we need spinning reserve at all times to cover those plants. With wind and solar we know how much output will be available and when at least a day in advance. There's no need for spinning reserve with wind and solar.

Wind and solar will bankrupt and are bankrupting thermal generators. We've now closed both nuclear and coal plants because they can't compete with wind and solar. That's how business works, you make a profit until someone comes along and takes your market away. At that point you go out of business.

"then markets need to pay conventional generators higher capacity prices"

Markets may, in a few situations, need to pay for capacity. That is something we already do either by direct capacity payments or very high MWh prices when those infrequently used generators are called on to produce.

" New wind/solar (at low penetration levels) may be cheaper than other NEW conventional resources, but without subsidies they are not cheaper than existing resources."

No, that is incorrect. New wind, unsubsidized, is now under 3 cents per kWh. That is cheaper than the operating costs of some paid off thermal plants. Solar, unsubsidized, is reaching 5 cents per kWh which undercuts the operating costs of some thermal plants.

"Because utility execs signing those deals don't recognize that everyone around them is doing the same thing. They will be selling their surplus wind generation at a significant loss and paying more for backup capacity."

Utility execs are signing wind and solar PPAs because they are huge bargains. Locking in electricity a <2c/kWh for 20 to 25 years is an absolute no-brainer. It's cheaper than the fuel for a CCNG. Buy RE, save fuel costs.

We're many years from any utility buying more wind and solar than they can use. When we reach that point we will probably be looking at wind and solar for about 2c/kWh. A utility could throw away (curtail) half its wind and solar and still be paying about 4c/kWh. Cheaper than some paid off thermal plants.

Overbuilding will probably become common. Cheaper to overbuild and curtail some percentage than to build storage and/or dispatchable generation.


-------

During low load months nuclear and fossil/hydro schedule PLANNED maintenance, which lowers their annual capacity factors. During the summer months the U.S. nuclear fleet typically operates at close to 98% availability and the hydro/thermal fleet at >90% availability.

Regarding spinning reserves, you have no idea what you are talking about. California ISO recently increased its regulation reserve requirement specifically due to renewable resource intermittency and forecasting error, and created a new "ramping" capacity product that will compensate conventional generators so that they can follow the net load ramp that occurs when solar falls off in the evening. ERCOT's day-ahead wind generation forecast frequently misses the mark by several thousand MWs which thermal generators cover for in the real-time market.

>>Utility execs are signing wind and solar PPAs because they are huge bargains. Locking in electricity a <2c/kWh for 20 to 25 years is an absolute no-brainer. It's cheaper than the fuel for a CCNG. Buy RE, save fuel costs.

With CCs you can actually choose when to generate. With wind overgen you are either curtailing (and losing out on your PTC payment) or selling into zero/negative prices. Again, $20/MWh isn't a bargain if you can only sell it for $0 (or could have purchased surplus wind from someone else for $0).

Wind curtailment has been an issue of inadequate transmission. Look at what has happened in ERCOT as they've built more transmission from the windy parts to the parts where people live.



![](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d4d53afb0145d060f4b3e9cbfba20e31bd5ec1196010af8a192ed77ba9f95a0b.jpg)



Grids have to have sufficient spinning reserve to cover those sorts of outages or risk cascading blackouts.

---------------
ERCOT wind curtailment is on a rapid upward trajectory since the beginning of 2016, and yes it will require more transmission to alleviate (ratepayers pick up that tab).


From mid-2015 to mid-2016 the daily average North America nuclear generation output didn't fluctuate more than 3 GW from one day to the next. Meanwhile aggregate wind generation at times fluctuated close to 20 GW from one day to the next.

Alberta set an all time electric system peak demand record earlier in December, and the roughly 20 wind farms there, with an aggregate capacity of about 1400 MW, were producing ZERO MW (that's right - zero) at the time of the new peak.

------

thermal plants also need backup and if you are going to charge wind and solar for backup then you need to charge thermal plants for backup. 


------

thermal plants need backup - 5-10% instead of 80-100%-

-------
If you have one 1 GW reactor on your grid you need spinning reserve to cover that 1 GW.

If you have lot of GW of both nuclear and coal then you could cheat back some on the amount of spinning reserve because their are few reasons why coal plants would shut down if the reactors tripped off.

Since thermal plants can and do go offline for days, weeks, months or years you need the ability to replace their generation. That's in addition to the spinning reserve you need in place for further sudden losses.
