Nine Updates on China’s 2016 Energy Storage Industry

In the first half of this year we observed some positive signs: China’s increasing electricity system reforms, the rise of the “energy internet,” and growing activity in frequency regulation and peak-load shifting in China’s North. We also saw some less positive developments such as increases in wind and solar curtailments. Good and bad alike, all of these developments underline the importance of energy storage in a wide array of fields, from renewable energy, distributed generation and microgrids, as well as in setting electricity prices.  From the beginning of 2016 to present, China’s energy storage industry took steps forward in project planning, policy support, and increasing product capacity.

ZHANGBEI, China–(BUSINESS WIRE)–BYD and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) have finished construction on what may be the world’s largest battery energy storage station. This large utility-scale project, located in Zhangbei, Hebei Province, combines 140 Mega-Watts of renewable energy generation (both wind & solar), 36 Mega-Watt-Hours (MWh) of energy storage and a smart power transmission system. While there are renewable generation systems of this scale in service today, there are no battery systems of this size. The State Grid system is demonstrating a stable solution for transferring vast amounts of renewable electricity safely to the grid on an unprecedented scale. Although BYD manufactures 1GW of solar panels annually, their role in this project was primarily providing energy storage batteries in arrays larger than a football field.

SGCC chose BYD’s Iron-Phosphate battery technology because of its superior service life (over 20 years) and also used BYD’s “peak shaving & load leveling” charge and discharge methodologies. BYD’s announcement September 30th, 2011, “China’s Largest and First Environmentally-friendly Battery Storage Station,” was the first of many MegaWatt-level cooperative projects with China’s Southern Power Grid (CSG). This new project with the State Grid has outpaced other grid projects in China and, though independently designed by SGCC, is part of the national “Golden Sun” program. The first phase investment with 100MW of Wind, 40MW of Solar and 36MWh of Battery is worth over $500M USD (~3.3 Billion RMB).

“The large-scale implementation of clean and green energy, such as wind and solar power, can only be realized when the technical difficulties of this new energy application in the utility system are resolved,” said Xiu Binglin, Deputy Director of the National Energy Administration. “This State Grid project demonstrates a solution and will be the model of development for China’s new energy resources.”

The US has about 80,000 existing dams. Roughly 2,500 are used for electricity generation. Based on a survey of dams on federal lands at least 10% should be useable for PuHS. The requirements are 1) adequate head (water height), 2) close to transmission lines, and 3) room for a small catchment pond below the dam.

The water used for PuHS is not sent downstream. It's released into a catchment basin as power is produced and then pumped back behind the dam when there is energy to be stored.

Even in dry areas PuHS can be used. Most have rainy seasons. A company in Utah has developed plans to build at least three PuHS facilities in the state. They've calculated that they can use an acceptable amount of the rainy season runoff and fill their reservoirs over a three year span. After that replacing the ~10% loss to evaporation would not be a problem.

As the climate changes some places will likely become dryer. In those places we may not be able to use PuHS. But other places will receive more precipitation. Warmer air means higher evaporation (the oceans are huge) and that higher moisture comes down when warm moist air hits cooler air. We're experiencing a rising rate of rain bombs.

Even power producing dams can be converted to PuHS. Replace the turbines with pump/turbines and pump water back behind the dam when there's no demand for the dam's output. What we do now is just to stop operation.

Evaporation is not going to be impacted in any meaningful way. Surface area will be modestly increased in those places where a new catchment area would be needed.

Then there are "turkey nests". PuHS facilities build on table lands or in hills close to the ocean. They use a shallow upper reservoir which is lined and the lower reservoir is the ocean.

Natural gas works great as a wind/solar fill in. But there are a couple of problems with it. First, burning NG adds more carbon to the atmosphere and drives climate change faster. Second, we will run out of NG.


-----------------------------------------------
I don't think the CCNG plants will become peakers, medium-long term. We're likely to start installing 'one day' storage as we install more wind and solar. That storage will do the 'peaking'. CCNG plants will drop back into backup roles, turning on when batteries are starting to be depleted and little wind/solar input expected.

Then we'll install enough storage to cover 2-3 days and CCNG's role will further shrink. But overall I expect that gas plants will turned on and left on for several hours to days at a time. Batteries will store any extra output and then do the demand/supply matching.

CCGT are both baseload now and peakers as can vary efficiently to 50% power following the load at 40% of the fuel, pollution, cost of SCGT.
Any need big grids had for batteries was made moot by these NG CCGTs.
'Storage' instead will be viable loads, generation, DG batteries, EVs, pumped storage, making batteries, metal, etc loads and supplies.
PowerPacks cost around $.20/kwhr plus the cost of electricity to charge them and when utilities can buy power all day, night long under $.06/kwhr at most, there is no need for them in big grids.
Now retail as their price drops to $.10/kwhr retail makes offgrid DG power so cheap leaving the grid saves 50% now in many cases as RE prices drop, 75% cheaper.

--------

Utilities are installing PowerPacks anyway for frequency regulation, since batteries are the only thing fast enough for really good frequency regulation, except capacitors which are much too expensive.

Utilities are overbuilding the frequency regulation installs.

Think about what that means. The utilities will promptly use those installs to deal with short-term peaks (of seconds or minutes) as well.



In general it takes 10 to 15 minutes to bring the gas turbine up to full speed in a CCNG plant. And then 3 to 4 hours to heat up the steam turbine portion of the gas plant. IIRC
