“A major shift in investment towards low-carbon sources of power generation is underway”, according to a first-ever detailed analysis of investment across the global energy system from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Yet, in non-OECD countries, “investment in conventional generation remains strong”, with over 75 GW of coal-fired power plants starting operation in 2015 in “developing Asia” – “as much as all renewable capacity additions in the region combined”. A “shift” may be underway – it is not going fast enough.



[IEA sees “major shift” – but not major enough](http://energypost.eu/iea-sees-major-shift-major-enough/). 




## Total investment

First of all, global energy investment declined last year by 8% (in real terms) to $1.8 trillion, mainly due to “a sharp fall in upstream oil and gas investment”. China “retook” the number one position from the US as top investor: whereas US investment in oil and gas production fell sharply, Chinese investment in the electricity sector rose to a “record level”.  China increased its investment both in renewable energy and in nuclear power.
