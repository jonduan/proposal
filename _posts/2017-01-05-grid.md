#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > Intro - Integration in the electricity network > Intro

 the concepts required to integrate renewable energy technologies into the electricity network. 

the differences between the traditional power systems and those of the future.

concepts such as microgrids and demand side management. 

introduced to power electronic converters and power control.


#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.1 Overview of Electric Power Systems

several concepts of electric power systems, including the main parts and functionalities of a power system.

Additionally, the differences between traditional power systems and future power systems

**Smart Grid**

the main parts and functionalities of a traditional power system

Generation, transmission and distribution

the main parts of a traditional power system are the generation (conformed by power plants), the transmission (where high voltage is used to transport the electricity for large distances), and the distribution system (through which the electricity reaches households and small and medium enterprises.



Typical voltage levels for the transmission system range from:
10 kilovolts to 1100 kilovolts

Examples of traditional power plants are: Thermal, hydro and nuclear

Which system feeds power to the residential and commercial loads?
Distribution



What is the main function of a traditional transformer: Transform the voltage levels

Elements found in substations are: Transformers, capacitor banks, switches, circuit breakers, monitoring equipment



Which of the following affirmations are correct for traditional power systems?
Most power plants are controllable and large
Large power plants operate on alternating current.


Which of the following statements are correct for the power systems of the future?
A high percentage of power plants will be driven by uncontrollable sources, as opposed to the controlled centralized power plants (mostly driven on fossil fuels).
There will a bidirectional power flow, for example when more power is generated at the distribution system than consumed.
Storage will play a major role due to the uncontrollable sources.
Smart grid concepts will be introduced to balance generation and consumption



#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.2 Demand Side Management and Microgrids 


microgrids will be introduced, including Demand Side Management and Demand Response.


Demand Side Management: control electricity demand
Demand Response: induce lower electricity use
Micro grid: a controlled,coordinated way


Two changes at that are occurring to distribution networks are:
the power flows are becoming bidirectional and the decision-making processes and control mechanisms are becoming distributed



When there is control and coordination at the distribution level, the operation of the distribution network is considered: Active


Two different modes of operation of microgrids are:grid-connected and islanded mode

Off-grid, islanded mode and autonomous mode refer to the same operation mode. Grid-connected is the alternative.


Some advantages to be provided by microgrids are: ease the integration of distributed generation, demand side management and storage


Indicate which of the following statements are correct:
Active power is the usable power, it is the portion of power that produces a net transfer of energy in one direction every cycle. The load is able to use this power to do work.
Direct current, abbreviated as DC, can be defined as an electric current that flows only in one direction.

Demand response makes use of “incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use, at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized”.


Microgrids are electricity distribution systems containing loads and distributed energy resources that can be operated in a controlled, coordinated way, either while connected to the main power network or while islanded.

The aim of demand side management is “to reduce energy consumption, and improve overall electricity usage efficiency, through the implementation of policies and methods that control electricity demand.



#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.3 Electrical Loads

##### Load


The following type of lamp has the lowest efficiency:


incandescent lamp > fluorescent lamps > LED lights



The LED lights is based on a semiconductor that emits light when current passes through it. Its main drawback is the effect on the power quality, as it produces distortion in the AC waveform.
