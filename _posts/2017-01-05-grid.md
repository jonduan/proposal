#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > Intro - Integration in the electricity network > Intro

 the concepts required to integrate renewable energy technologies into the electricity network. 

the differences between the traditional power systems and those of the future.

concepts such as microgrids and demand side management. 

introduced to power electronic converters and power control.


#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.1 Overview of Electric Power Systems

several concepts of electric power systems, including the main parts and functionalities of a power system.

Additionally, the differences between traditional power systems and future power systems



the main parts and functionalities of a traditional power system

Generation, transmission and distribution

the main parts of a traditional power system are the generation (conformed by power plants), the transmission (where high voltage is used to transport the electricity for large distances), and the distribution system (through which the electricity reaches households and small and medium enterprises.



Typical voltage levels for the transmission system range from:
10 kilovolts to 1100 kilovolts

Examples of traditional power plants are:
