 the concepts required to integrate renewable energy technologies into the electricity network. 

the differences between the traditional power systems and those of the future.

concepts such as microgrids and demand side management. 

introduced to power electronic converters and power control.


#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.1 Overview of Electric Power Systems

several concepts of electric power systems, including the main parts and functionalities of a power system.

Additionally, the differences between traditional power systems and future power systems

**Smart Grid**

##### the main parts and functionalities of a traditional power system

Generation, transmission and distribution

the main parts of a traditional power system are the generation (conformed by power plants), the transmission (where high voltage is used to transport the electricity for large distances), and the distribution system (through which the electricity reaches households and small and medium enterprises.



Typical voltage levels for the transmission system range from:
10 kilovolts to 1100 kilovolts

Examples of traditional power plants are: Thermal, hydro and nuclear

##### Which system feeds power to the residential and commercial loads?
Distribution



##### What is the main function of a traditional transformer: Transform the voltage levels

Elements found in substations are: Transformers, capacitor banks, switches, circuit breakers, monitoring equipment



##### Which of the following affirmations are correct for traditional power systems?
Most power plants are controllable and large
Large power plants operate on alternating current.


##### Which of the following statements are correct for the power systems of the future?

A high percentage of power plants will be driven by uncontrollable sources, as opposed to the controlled centralized power plants (mostly driven on fossil fuels).

There will a bidirectional power flow, for example when more power is generated at the distribution system than consumed.
Storage will play a major role due to the uncontrollable sources.

Smart grid concepts will be introduced to balance generation and consumption



#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.2 Demand Side Management and Microgrids 


microgrids will be introduced, including Demand Side Management and Demand Response.


Demand Side Management: control electricity demand

Demand Response: induce lower electricity use

Micro grid: a controlled,coordinated way


Two changes at that are occurring to distribution networks are:
the power flows are becoming bidirectional and the decision-making processes and control mechanisms are becoming distributed



When there is control and coordination at the distribution level, the operation of the distribution network is considered: Active


Two different modes of operation of microgrids are:grid-connected and islanded mode

Off-grid, islanded mode and autonomous mode refer to the same operation mode. Grid-connected is the alternative.


Some advantages to be provided by microgrids are: ease the integration of distributed generation, demand side management and storage


Indicate which of the following statements are correct:
Active power is the usable power, it is the portion of power that produces a net transfer of energy in one direction every cycle. The load is able to use this power to do work.

Direct current, abbreviated as DC, can be defined as an electric current that flows only in one direction.

According to EURELECTRIC demand response makes use of
**Demand response** makes use of “incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use, at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized”.

he official definition of a microgrid, as given by the CIGRÉ Working Group is the following:
**Microgrids** are electricity distribution systems containing loads and distributed energy resources that can be operated in a controlled, coordinated way, either while connected to the main power network or while islanded.

According to the EURELECTRIC association, the aim of demand side management is:
The aim of **demand side management** is “to reduce energy consumption, and improve overall electricity usage efficiency, through the implementation of policies and methods that control electricity demand.

three main characteristics:

First, the microgrid can be considered an integration platform for distributed generators, storage devices, and controllable loads, at distribution level.

Second, control and coordination at the distribution level means, that there is an active operation of the distribution grid.

In contrast to a passive distribution grid, penetrated by distributed sources, but where no control or coordination is implemented, a microgrid allows to manage and coordinate the available sources and the controllable loads.

This allows the power balance between generation and consumption. Third, microgrids have two modes of operation: grid-connected and islanded mode.

##### Two changes at that are occurring to distribution networks are:

the power flows are becoming bidirectional and the decision-making processes and control mechanisms are becoming distributed

When there is control and coordination at the distribution level, the operation of the distribution network is considered: Active

Off-grid, islanded mode and autonomous mode refer to the same operation mode. Grid-connected is the alternative.

##### Some advantages to be provided by microgrids are:

ease the integration of distributed generation, demand side management and storage 

Direct current, abbreviated as DC, can be defined as an electric current that flows only in one direction.

Alternating current, abbreviated as AC, is defined as a periodic electric current that reverses direction. It can have different shapes. In traditional power systems it has a sinodal shape.

Active power is the usable power, it is the portion of power that produces a net transfer of energy in one direction every cycle. The load is able to use this power to do work.

Reactive power is the portion of power that returns to the source in each cycle and, therefore, the load is able to use this power to do work.







#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.3 Electrical Loads

##### Load


The following type of lamp has the lowest efficiency:


incandescent lamp < fluorescent lamps < LED lights



The LED lights is based on a semiconductor that emits light when current passes through it. Its main drawback is the effect on the power quality, as it produces distortion in the AC waveform.

Most heat loads do not consumer reactive power because they are based on a: resistor


Some loads do consumer reactive power because they are based on a: inductor


One classification of loads is: residential, commercial and industrial

Commercial and industrial loads are generally connected at the distribution level (10 kV - 72.5 kV) or at the sub-transmission level (110 kV - 150 kV).

Residential loads are connected to the distribution system.

Distribution transformers are used to bring voltage down to lower levels, for example from 10 kV to 400 V.

Future loads are likely to be bidirectional and larger loads will be connected to the system

on the subject of power electronic converters.

In this lecture, the DC-DC converters and DC-AC converters also known as inverters are discussed.

Explanation
The circuit shown corresponds to an inverter. As explained in the lecture, the output of this simple circuit is a square wave, that is, a signal with two possible values, one positive and another negative, both with the same magnitude.




##### Which of the following statements is correct

Inverters are necessary when we want to connect a DC generation unit, such as a photovoltaic panel to the AC distribution network. 

Power converters also allow to adjust the output voltage level so that a load can be connected.


Transmission losses can be reduced when power is transmitted at higher voltages.

The ratio between the time when the switch is on and the complete period is called Duty Cycle. The average output voltage is proportional to the duty cycle.

 the control mechanisms used in electricity grids. Primary, secondary and tertiary control mechanisms will be discussed.



##### If we assume that the mechanical power supplied by the prime mover stays constant,

When the electric active power output decreases, an accelerating power arises. 

If there are more loads in the system, the electric power output increases, a decelerating power occurs, 



#####　Centrifugal governor  controls the speed of the steam engine in traditional power plants



##### Tertiary control operates generally under time frames close to 24 hours in traditional power systems

Three generators operate at a rated frequency of 60 Hz. Their rated powers are 300 MW, 500 MW and 600 MW, respectively. Let’s assume that several large loads suddenly disconnected from the system, which caused an increase in the frequency of 0.3 Hz. Through the application of primary control, each generator ended up reducing their supply by -30 MW, -62.5 MW and -100 MW, respectively.


-------


Based on this reduction, what is the droop characteristic of each of these generators?

(In percentage, without decimals, for example if the answer is 10%, then write it as 10)

The droop characteristic of the first generator is:5


The droop characteristic of the second generator is:4


The droop characteristic of the third generator is:3


Explanation

DeltaP_gi = (-P_gi / R_gi) * (DeltaFreq / freq), where R_gi is the droop characteristic.

Therefore, the droop characteristic is:

R_gi = (-P_gi / DeltaP_gi) * (DeltaFreq / freq)


the total power change (in MW) in the system that caused the increase in frequency

Total power change = -30 + -62.5 + -100

the network power frequency characteristic λ?

(Give your answer in MW/Hz, with two decimals. Format of the answer: 123.45)

lambda = -DeltaP / DeltaFreq = -(-192.5 MW)/(0.3 Hz) = 641.67 MW/Hz


#### Week 8: Integration in the Electricity Network > 8.7 Power Control, Part 2 > Lecture


A more in-depth analysis regarding the control mechanisms required by future electricity systems is given in this lecture.



In traditional power systems the power balance is achieved by controlling the generation plants by means of the governor.

The power system of the future will have a high participation of renewable sources, such as offshore wind parks and solar parks, which are not controllable.

This poses new challenges to the system.

The primary, secondary and tertiary control should then account not only for changes in the demand of the system, but also for changes in generation coming from the uncontrollable sources.

In order to cope with these challenges, more complex control and optimization algorithms are required, as well as forecasting methods not only for the demand, but also for the generation.

Some of the forecasts that are likely to be considered in the future are:
Demand forecasting Wind and Photovoltaic production forecasting Heat demand forecasting and Electricity price forecasting

In large power systems with high participation of offshore wind generation and large solar parks, forecasting methods and storage will play an important role.

In traditional power systems, Primary control is performed locally at the generation unit. On the other hand, secondary and tertiary control are applied in a centralized way. However this is likely to change in the future. Let’s have a look at the difference between centralized and decentralized control.

A centralized control is more suitable if there are common goals or a common operation environment.

The number of nodes is generally limited, and the number of message exchanges is also limited.

In this case, suboptimal solutions lead to profit losses. A decentralized control is more suitable if there are multiple actors with different goals.

In this case, a suboptimal solution is probably acceptable given the high costs related to the communication network and complexity of the system.
Decentralized control has the potential to operate in systems containing a large amount of distributed generation and actors.






Coal power plants generation plants uses a speed governor for its control


In traditional power systems Primary control is performed locally


A decentralized control is more suitable for which of the following situations (you can select more than one)?


 - If there are multiple actors with different goals 

 - If there’s a large amount of distributed generation and actors 


By applying demand side bidding, consumers are allowed to provide bids to shift their demand or allow its curtailment.

 - In the Shift Option consumers can place two different bids, one for the supply of their high priority loads and one for their low priority loads 



 - In the Curtailment Option consumers can offer to turn-off low priority loads at fixed prices
