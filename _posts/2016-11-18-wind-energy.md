 - The 30-megwawatt development to go into service in November
 - Europe has more than 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind
 - developers have already installed nearly 10,000 megawatts in Germany, the U.K. and Denmark alone. On Tuesday, the U.K. approved what will be the worldâ€™s largest offshore wind farm: an 1,800 megawatt development off the Yorkshire Coast that will cost 6 billion pounds ($7.8 billion).
