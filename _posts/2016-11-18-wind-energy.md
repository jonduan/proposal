[Deepwater Wind LLC](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-16/deepwater-nearing-completion-on-first-u-s-offshore-wind-project) is on the verge of completing the first offshore wind farm in U.S. waters, a milestone for an industry that has struggled for a more than decade to build in North America.

 - The 30-megwawatt development to go into service in November
 - Europe has more than 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind
 - developers have already installed nearly 10,000 megawatts in Germany, the U.K. and Denmark alone. On Tuesday, the U.K. approved what will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm: an 1,800 megawatt development off the Yorkshire Coast that will cost 6 billion pounds ($7.8 billion).

### Wind energy potential in Japan

In this exercise only shallow offshore wind will be considered (due to the high Japanese population density). The coast-line in Japan is rather steep. For distances larger than 2 km out of the coastline, the depth of the Pacific and Japanese Sea, is on average deeper than 25 meters. This we will consider unsuitable for affordable construction of wind turbines. 

The figure below shows a map with the averaged wind speeds around Japan.

The Japanese coast-line as depicted in the figure has a total length of 5700 km. 
Consider that 30% of the Japanese coast-line would be covered with shallow offshore wind farms. 
The wind turbines have a conversion efficiency of C=50%. 
Inhabitants of Japan: 127 million
In this exercise we do not take the indeterminacy of wind energy into account. So this means that we assume that all energy that is produced can be consumed immediately and there is no mismatch in demand and supply of electricity so storage will not be needed.

What is the total land area for installation of wind farms expressed in km², considering that only 30% of the Japanese coast-line suitable for shallow offshore wind farms.


Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,
width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,
Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²
Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,
width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,
Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²
