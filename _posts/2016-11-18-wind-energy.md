[Week 5: Wind Energy > Intro - Wind Energy](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016/courseware/8b0ff754981f4364a80eec39b14ede03/8a2b73ee0fbf4d11a81369f765d095ac/)

First we are going to look into the market of Wind Energy. Then we will look into more depth into wind as a source, aerodynamics, the relation between wind speed and power, and the transmission of the electricity from the turbine to the consumer. You will also learn about future trends in Wind Energy.



#### Week 5: Wind Energy > 5.1 Market Analysis

How many wind turbines are installed each year? 

Which countries generate the maximum percentage of their electricity requirements from the wind? Is offshore energy the future?



###### How many turbines?

In 2012, Denmark produced 30% of its electricity through wind energy. If the total production was 30 700 GWh, approximately how many modern 5 MW wind turbines would be needed to produce the relevant wind energy assuming that the turbines operated at 25% of their capacity?

2 800

The rated power multiplied by the capacity factor and the number of hours in a year, gives the annual power production of one turbine.

#### Week 5: Wind Energy > 5.2 Wind energy resource 



How and why does the wind blow?

What provides wind with the energy that wind turbines convert into electricity? Is there a difference between the wind on land and at sea?

[Deepwater Wind LLC](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-16/deepwater-nearing-completion-on-first-u-s-offshore-wind-project) is on the verge of completing the first offshore wind farm in U.S. waters, a milestone for an industry that has struggled for a more than decade to build in North America.

 - The 30-megwawatt development to go into service in November
 - Europe has more than 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind
 - developers have already installed nearly 10,000 megawatts in Germany, the U.K. and Denmark alone. On Tuesday, the U.K. approved what will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm: an 1,800 megawatt development off the Yorkshire Coast that will cost 6 billion pounds ($7.8 billion).

### Wind energy potential in Japan

In this exercise only shallow offshore wind will be considered (due to the high Japanese population density). The coast-line in Japan is rather steep. For distances larger than 2 km out of the coastline, the depth of the Pacific and Japanese Sea, is on average deeper than 25 meters. This we will consider unsuitable for affordable construction of wind turbines. 

The figure below shows a map with the averaged wind speeds around Japan.

The Japanese coast-line as depicted in the figure has a total length of 5700 km. 
Consider that 30% of the Japanese coast-line would be covered with shallow offshore wind farms. 
The wind turbines have a conversion efficiency of C=50%. 
Inhabitants of Japan: 127 million
In this exercise we do not take the indeterminacy of wind energy into account. So this means that we assume that all energy that is produced can be consumed immediately and there is no mismatch in demand and supply of electricity so storage will not be needed.

##### What is the total land area for installation of wind farms expressed in km², considering that only 30% of the Japanese coast-line suitable for shallow offshore wind farms.


Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,
width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,
Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²
Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,
width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,
Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²



The wind power per land area (m²) generated P is expressed by the following equation:

windpower per area

where ρ is the mass density of the air (=1.3 kg/m3), C is the conversion efficiency of the windturbine, and v is the averaged wind speed. 


Using the windmap, we estimate that the average windspeed is v = 6 m/s.

How much windpower can be collected per m² of shallow water in Japan?


conversion factor C = 0.5
density = 1.3 kg/m3
From the map we estimate that v= 6 m/s.
filling in formula gives 2.205 W/m²
other answers use v= 4.5 , 5 or 7 m/s


In this case, how much energy expressed in kWh/day per person could be produced using windpower in shallow water? Assume a 100% capacity factor.

Total power: 3.42⋅10⁹ (m²) x 2.2 (Wm⁻²) =7.52⋅10⁹ (W) = 7.524⋅10⁶ kW.
Energy per person per day:
7.524⋅10⁶ (kW) × 24 (h) / 127⋅10⁶ (persons) = 1.42 kWh/p/d
