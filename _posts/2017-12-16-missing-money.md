## A New Post

There have been a number of actions taken to ameliorate the revenue adequacy problem.
These include increases in the level of price caps on energy and ancillary services, the creation of additional electricity products that better match system operator needs for maintaining reliability without resorting to out-of market actions, and (or in addition to) the creation of capacity markets. The implementation of many of these solutions to the revenue adequacy problem also reflect concerns about market power emerging during very tight supply situations and the mitigation of market power is typically a key design feature. Three of the papers in this symposium focus on capacity market design and performance issues. One examines an alternative approach to the revenue adequacy problem.
