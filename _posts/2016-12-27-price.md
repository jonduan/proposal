###### Gas Prices in the USA and Germany

David mentioned that increased gas production in the US, coupled with the difficulty exporting it, have driven gas prices down in the US. Let’s see if BP’s data on gas prices supports this claim.

across this 15-year period the price of natural gas in the USA has fallen relative to the price in other countries.



##### Energy in Developed Economies

David mentions a few times during the course that the energy inputs into developed economies is about 5% of GDP. Let’s try estimating this now, using data from the US.

Fortunately, the EIA has detailed data on the total revenue from sales of electricity to consumers, which does a lot of the job for us.

Looking at the LLNL sankey diagram, we can see that if we have data for the total cost of electricity, the main remaining inputs into the four sectors of the economy are natural gas and oil. (There’s also a small amount of coal and biomass and tiny amounts of geothermal and solar, which we’ll ignore.) We can find data for the price of oil and gas delivered to different sectors, and use that to get the total cost of those two resources. Combined with the total cost of electricity, we’ll have a pretty good estimate of the total cost of energy inputs into the US economy. You’ll also get lots of practice using sankey diagrams, looking up energy prices, and converting units.
