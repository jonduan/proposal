## France to shut down all coal-fired power plants by 2023
Two years before the UK has pledged to stop burning the fossil fuel


[Speaking at an annual UN climate change conference on Wednesday, Mr Hollande vowed to beat by two years the UK's commitment to stop using the fossil fuel to generate power by 2025.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-close-coal-plants-shut-down-2023-global-warming-climate-change-a7422966.html)

“We need carbon neutrality by 2050,” the French President continued, promising that coal will no longer form part of France's energy mix in six to seven years’ time.




## Canada set to phase out coal-fired power by 2030

France is already a world leader in low-carbon energy. The country has invested heavily in nuclear power over the past few decades and now derives more than 75 per cent of its electricity from nuclear fission. It produces so much nuclear energy, in fact, that it exports much of it to nearby nations, making around £2.5 billion each year.


Germany has said it is to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 percent by 2050, the UK has pledged to wipe out coal power by 2025, and Chinese president Xi Jinping said China would continue its fight against global warming “whatever the circumstances", although it stressed the importance of cooperation with the US.
