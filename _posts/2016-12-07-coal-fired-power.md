## Canada set to phase out coal-fired power by 2030


[Closure of power stations will remove emissions equivalent to 1.3 million cars](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canada-renewable-energy-catherine-mckenna-coal-fired-power-2030-a7430471.html)

The move to accelerate weaning Canada off coal comes as Austria, Britain, Denmark, France and the Netherlands do the same.

Canada will close its coal-fired power plants by 2030 as part of its strategy to cut greenhouse gas emission under the Paris climate accord, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna announced on Monday.

The plants, located in four provinces, produce about 10 per cent of Canada's total CO2 emissions, and closing them will remove the equivalent in emissions of 1.3 million cars from roads, or five megatons of greenhouse gas emissions, she told a press conference.

“As part of our government's vision for a clean growth economy, we will be accelerating the transition from traditional coal power to clean energy by 2030,” she said

With an abundance of hydroelectric power, as well as nuclear, solar and wind power, 80 per cent of Canada's electricity production emits no air pollution.

McKenna said she aims to ramp that up to 90 per cent by 2030. Citing National Energy Board figures, she noted that wind power-generating capacity increased twenty-fold in the past decade while solar capacity rose 125 per cent.

The minister, however, added that carbon capture would be an acceptable substitute to closing a plant if Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or Saskatchewan province wished to continue burning coal.

Saskatchewan has resisted strong climate action, which it says would harm its vast agricultural and burgeoning oil sectors.

It is testing the world's first large-scale carbon capture and storage, built into a SaskPower coal-fired plant in the Canadian prairies.

Ottawa economics professor and energy policy expert Jean-Thomas Bernard, however, said efforts to capture and store coal have proven to be costly - Can$1.4 billion for the SaskPower Boundary Dam pilot project to produce 115 megawatts of electricity.

“We've been talking about clean coal for 20 years and it's not yet realized commercially so there must be major difficulties with the technology,” he said.

“Coal is a relatively small part” of Canada's energy mix, he added.

Most of the coal plants in Canada are “quite old” and could be replaced with clean alternatives at “very reasonable costs,” he told AFP.

Ms McKenna also set a new more ambitious goal of reducing total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, from 2005 levels.






## France to shut down all coal-fired power plants by 2023
Two years before the UK has pledged to stop burning the fossil fuel


[Speaking at an annual UN climate change conference on Wednesday, Mr Hollande vowed to beat by two years the UK's commitment to stop using the fossil fuel to generate power by 2025.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-close-coal-plants-shut-down-2023-global-warming-climate-change-a7422966.html)

“We need carbon neutrality by 2050,” the French President continued, promising that coal will no longer form part of France's energy mix in six to seven years’ time.


France is already a world leader in low-carbon energy. The country has invested heavily in nuclear power over the past few decades and now derives more than 75 per cent of its electricity from nuclear fission. It produces so much nuclear energy, in fact, that it exports much of it to nearby nations, making around £2.5 billion each year.



## Finland plans to completely phase out coal by 2030
Renewable sources accounted for 40 per cent of all energy consumption in [Finland](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-plans-completely-phase-out-coal-2030-a7438731.html) last year

Finland has announced plans to phase out coal by 2030 in a bid to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. 

The government announced the goal on Thursday in its "Energy and Climate Strategy for 2030 and Beyond", which details plans to stop producing energy from coal within 14 years, make energy production carbon-neutral by 2050 and replace traditional power sources with bio-fuels and renewable energy. 

The Nordic country has been steadily reducing its coal use since 2011, with coal-fired power generation accounted for seven per cent of all electricity production last year, according to Reuters.  

Last year, renewable sources accounted for 40 per cent of all energy consumption in Finland and is estimated to reach 47 per cent by 2030 under the proposed measures - just shy of the government target of 50 per cent. 

"Utilising the potential of Finnish renewable energy to produce electricity at an industrial level is one of the central questions in achieving long-term energy and climate goals," Finland's Economic Affairs Minister Oli Rehn said on Thursday.

"The national climate and energy strategy decided today in the Cabinet meets the tough targets from a Finnish standpoint."

The Nordic country currently uses a quarter of its electricity on heating homes, and is required by the European Union to cut emissions from housing, transport and agriculture by 39 percent by 2030. This means increasing biofuels and renewable sources, such as leftover products from the forest industry and wind power. 

The targets will be partly met by increasing the number of electric cars on Finnish roads from 1,000 to 250,000 by 2030 and the number biogas-driven cars from a current negligible number to 50,000, goals Transport and Communications Minister Anne Berner has described as "demanding". 

Although the government wants to phase out coal, it will continue to in the near-term to burn peat, largely due to the fact it is produced domestically. 


## 2,500 new coal plants will thwart any Paris pledges


![The new plants will emit 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/01021/c7870954-9865-11e5_1021154c.jpg)

**More than 2,400 coal-fired power stations are under construction or being planned around the world, a study has revealed two weeks after Britain pledged to stop burning coal.**

The new plants will emit 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and undermine the efforts at the Paris climate conference to limit global warming to 2C. China is building 368 plants and planning a further 803, according to the study by [four climate change research bodies](http://climateactiontracker.org/assets/publications/briefing_papers/CAT_Coal_Gap_Briefing_COP21.pdf), including Ecofys and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. India is building 297 and planning 149. 


Rich countries are also planning new coal plants. The nuclear disaster at Fukushima has prompted Japan to turn back to coal, with 40 plants in the pipeline and five under construction. –Ben Webster, [The Times, 2 December 2015](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/article4629455.ece)

Britain pledged before the Paris summit to close its 12 coal plants by 2025 and restrict their use from 2023. Some are being converted to burn American wood pellets.


## 100% renewable energy by 2050

Nearly 50 countries vow to use 100% renewable energy by 2050
The signatories are countries who are disproportionately affected by global warming such as Ethiopia and the Maldives


![Greenpeace stage a protest outside the UN Climate Change Conference 2016 (COP22) in Marrakech, Morocco Reuters](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/18/16/reuters-marrakech-greenpeace-stage.jpg)

Nearly 50 countries vulnerable to climate change have agreed to use only renewable energy by 2050.

The 48 members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum made the decision while attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco.

The Climate Vulnerable Forum was set up in 2009 and is made up of countries that are disproportionately affected by climate change.

Members, including the likes of Ethiopia, Marshall Islands and Bangladesh, agreed to make their energy production 100 per cent renewable "as rapidly as possible" and by between 2030 and 2050 at the latest.



## cut  greenhouse gas emissions


Germany has said it is to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95 percent by 2050, the UK has pledged to wipe out coal power by 2025, and Chinese president Xi Jinping said China would continue its fight against global warming “whatever the circumstances", although it stressed the importance of cooperation with the US.

英国、澳大利亚和荷兰等国家，也已相继宣布了将在10年到15年里逐步淘汰煤炭的计划，但都没有芬兰这么坚决。

尽管各国制定的计划不同，但正有越来越多的国家加入“去煤化”俱乐部。

事实上，2015年，全球煤炭消费就迎来了有记录以来的最大跌幅。

已连续出版65年的《BP世界能源统计年鉴》显示，2015年，全球煤炭消费降低了1.8%，远低于其2.1%的十年平均增长率。煤炭在全球一次能源消费中占比降至29.2%，刷新自2005年以来的最低纪录。

该报告的另一项数据也显示，中国灰霾天数与煤炭消费量呈正相关。

“富煤，贫油，少气” ，是中国能源资源的鲜明特点。中国煤炭资源总量 5.9 万亿吨，占一次能源资源总量的94%，石油、天然气资源仅占 6%。

中国政府已经明确提出，要逐步降低煤炭消费比重。但定下的目标却是，到2020年，煤炭消费比重控制在62%以内，仅仅比2015年低2个百分点。

这也是无奈之举，在能源消耗总量不变甚至增长的基础上，减少煤炭消费，意味需要更多的其他能源取而代之。然而，短时间内，新能源和可再生能源难堪大任，中国的能源消费只能以煤炭为主。
