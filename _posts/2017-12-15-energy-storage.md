## Energy Storage



http://reneweconomy.com.au/explainer-what-the-tesla-big-battery-can-and-cannot-do-42387/
Battery storage can do a bunch of different things – smooth out the output from renewables when clouds come over or the wind dies down, store power for sale at peak times or high prices, or for night-time use, and even remove the need for new grid infrastructure.

They can also provide a whole range of what are called “network services” – and providing frequency control and “synthetic inertia” are the top of that list. In all, there are about 20 different things it can do in its “value stack” – think of it as the Swiss army knife of the energy system. In practice, one installation may focus on only one or just a few of those pitons.

It will provide much needed network support, so if there are more network failures, or if the big gas generators trip again like they did in March then battery storage will play a critical role in keeping the grid stable and the lights on, particularly with its fast response capabilities.

It can respond to faults in an instant – in milliseconds – while the big gas generators are still asleep in the back of the bus.  The gas generators take at least six seconds before responding at all, and up to 10 minutes to get dressed.

Over the longer term, South Australia and other grids will need more battery storage, but also more forms of storage that is  longer term (hours and days) and bigger capacity. This could come from pumped hydro, solar thermal, and even hydrogen. Battery storage will likely remain the quickest to respond, and the cheapest over short periods, so will play a critical role.

But work by Lloyds Register found that a battery of around 100MW could have been sufficient to do the job of dealing with those sudden changes in frequency and voltage in those dramatic seconds when one tower after another collapsed and three major transmission lines failed. Whether the system would have been able to ride through the remaining issues is not known, but batteries would have given it a fighting chance.

It  will change the way we think about energy, from the old baseload, peak load paradigm, to a new one based around the cheapest form of new generation “base cost renewables” (wind and solar), and then flexible or dispatchable generation to fill in the gaps. (See graph above).

In South Australia, this level of wind and solar had reached saturation point with wind and solar accounting already for 50 per cent of demand. But storage will allow those penetrations to jump significantly.

Of the 100MW/129MWh in this array, around 70MW of capacity is contracted to the South Australian government to provide grid stability and system security. It will likely mostly provide frequency and ancillary services (FCAS) when needed (such as a major system fault, generator trip or transmission failure).

This part of the battery is designed to last 10 minutes, which sounds short but is long enough to keep the grid stable while slower machines such as gas generators can respond.


The other 30MW of capacity will have three hours storage, and will be used as load shifting by Neoen for the Hornsdale wind farm, where it will be located.








## Tesla big battery shows off its flexibility in final testing

Presumably, the aim will be to take advantage of quick changes in wholesale prices, or simply to charge up when prices are low and discharge when they are high, and to help meet peak demand (which it did later Thursday, see update below).

The battery is also contracted by the government to provide fast-response stability services to the grid. A full explainer of what it can and cannot do can be found here.


AEMO called on the Tesla big battery to ramp up to fill in the gaps as the amount of wind generation died off and temperatures soared. It fed 70MW into one 5-minute period, and over the 30 minute settlement period (5pm) 59MW, and  11MW into the next one.

Not only did it help the grid right through a peak when there was little wind, and moderate wholesale eletricity prices, it also meant one expensive gas peaking plant did not have to be switched on.  

## Tesla big battery outsmarts lumbering coal units after Loy Yang trips

The Tesla big battery is having a big impact on Australia’s electricity market, far beyond the South Australia grid where it was expected to time shift a small amount of wind energy and provide network services and emergency back-up in case of a major problem.

Data from AEMO (and gathered above by Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College) shows that the Tesla big battery responded four seconds ahead of the generator contracted at that time to provide FCAS (frequency control and ancillary services), the Gladstone coal generator in Queensland.

But in reality, the response from the Tesla big battery was even quicker than that – in milliseconds – but too fast for the AEMO data to record.

Importantly, by the time that the contracted Gladstone coal unit had gotten out of bed and put its socks on so it can inject more into the grid – it is paid to respond in six seconds – the fall in frequency had already been arrested and was being reversed.

It is contracted to provide such grid services by the South Australia government.

Over the weekend was again illustrating its rapid fire charging and discharging. (See graph above). The rapid re-bidding is likely to change the market forever, particularly when the 5-minute settlement rule finally comes into effect in 2021.

The interesting thing here is the speed with which Tesla responded to the contingency FCAS market, which is triggered after frequency gets to 49.8Hz. That was pretty much instantaneous. And they did it from a standing start, unlike the other generators.

Again, the Tesla big battery repeated its dose of last week, hopping in with a milli-second respond to help arrest the fall in frequency caused by the sudden loss of 353MW of capacity.

This time, the battery injected 16MW for frequency control before returning to take advantage of the price spike caused by the sudden loss of capacity (prices jumped 50 per cent to $119/MWh).

### Question

[‘Finkel’s new energy report’ isn’t new and it isn’t by Finkel](https://theconversation.com/finkels-new-energy-report-isnt-new-and-it-isnt-by-finkel-87763)


how much energy storage – whether in batteries, pumped hydro or solar thermal – we will need as we increasingly rely on renewable, and therefore intermittent, electricity generation.


[Australia, energy storage and the Blakers study](http://euanmearns.com/australia-energy-storage-and-the-blakers-study/).

Modeling 100% renewable energy scenarios has become a popular activity among academics. An example is the recent study published by Professor Andrew Blakers et al., which based on model results concluded that 100% renewable generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) grid area of eastern Australia could be supported by only 400-500 GWh of energy storage. In his recent post Roger Young concluded that the true requirement was closer to 6,800 GWh, over thirteen times higher.

[New Finkel report finds no need to panic about energy storage](http://reneweconomy.com.au/new-finkel-report-finds-no-need-to-panic-about-energy-storage-42755/)
A new report into energy storage commissioned by chief scientist Alan Finkel highlights the enormous opportunities for storage in Australia, but underlines how little is actually needed over the short to medium term, even at relatively high levels of wind and solar.


## Tesla battery races to save Australia grid from coal plant crash – injecting 7MW in milliseconds

https://flipboard.com/@flipboard/-tesla-battery-races-to-save-australia-g/f-1c5dc39e33%2Felectrek.co

"Tesla’s world record sized 100MW/129MWh lithium ion battery reacted within milliseconds when an Australia coal power plant removed itself from the power grid last Thursday. Technically, the Tesla battery responded to the trip event, and finished its work, before the coal plant’s backup plant finished its start up process."

The purpose of this battery was specifically to defend the power grid from trips like this after outages in the summer of 2016.

According to the RenewEconomy, the data of the Tesla battery’s response was faster than the Australian Market Energy Operator (AEMO) data collection hardware could record.

the unit showed off its fast reaction ability by switching from charging off of the grid to delivering electricity to the grid, at least 14 times within a 4 hour period.


The Tesla power plant did two amazing things.

First, the power plant responded to the grid frequency challenge before the offending coal plant actually finished tripping itself from the power grid. That’s not like telling the future, but it’s so fast you’d start questioning things.

And secondly, it finished its work of stabilizing the grid and shut back down before the regular backup plant even started its work. Because of the slower nature of fossil fuels generator, literally spinning up a massive turbine, they’re designed to deliver far more energy than is needed to the power grid. As a form of insurance.

This makes our grid more stable, and in the long run, it’ll save significant amounts of money.



## Tesla 100MW battery flexes muscles early this morning – delivers 70MWh of ‘stored wind power’, shows off fast switching

https://electrek.co/2017/11/30/tesla-100mw-battery-flexes-muscles-early-this-morning-delivers-70mw-of-stored-wind-energy-shows-off-fast-switching/


The 100MW/129MWh Tesla battery delivered in 100 days has begun testing. And – for the first time – on Thursday at 4:30 PM in Australia, early this morning in the US, the power plant delivered 70MW of ‘stored wind power’ during the peak electricity demand period.

Elon Musk, on March 9th of this year, promised via a tweet that he could deliver this battery within 100 days – or it’d be free.

The facility, which is called the Hornsdale Power Reserve, will be the largest li-ion battery ever deployed at 100MW/129MWh. The plant is located next to Neoen’s ‘Hornsdale Windfarm.’ It was commissioned by the South Australian government, though the total price of it has not been revealed. It was part of a $390 million energy project. Tesla beat 90 other competitive bids for this process.

The unit also got to show off its ability to switch quickly from charging to pushing electrons onto the power grid. According to the below image from RenewEconomy, it looks like during a 4 hour period the battery was able to switch state at least 14 times.

A report in Minnesota suggested that right now, the net cost of a solar power plus storage power plant is cheaper than a natural gas peaker power plant – as seen in the right two columns in the graph below. In fact, energy storage alone – without the cheap electricity coming from a renewable plant – is almost the same cost as a peaker plant.


### Energy Storage Paired with Solar Found to Be More Cost Effective in Minnesota Today than Natural Gas Peaking Plants 
https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/energy-storage-paired-solar-more-cost-effective-mn-today


As federal policy on renewable energy is being rolled back, a new UMN-led report finds that when environmental benefits are considered combined energy storage and solar arrays can be a more cost-effective alternative in Minnesota – implementable today – to natural gas peaking plants, which are fired up only to meet peak demand.

The report, “Modernizing Minnesota’s Grid: An Economic Analysis of Energy Storage Opportunities,” is the result of months-long effort led by the Energy Transition Lab (ETL) at the University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment. Lessons learned could also be applied to other Midwest states that are in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) footprint.

“Energy storage is a linchpin for Minnesota: It has the potential to reduce our system costs, increase electric grid resiliency, and even decrease greenhouse gas emissions in our broader coal-dependent region,” said Ellen Anderson, director of the Energy Transition Lab. “While the federal government questions the reliability of renewable energy, states like Minnesota are stepping up to show it’s possible to connect renewables and storage to reduce both costs and greenhouse gas emissions, while maintaining a reliable grid.”

In addition to showing that storage plus solar already could be more cost effective than peaking gas plants, including environmental benefits, the analysis shows that the deployment of storage in Minnesota is projected to increase the use of low-cost renewable energy generation dispatched in MISO and to reduce the need for expensive transmission investments.

Furthermore, it shows that as standalone storage becomes more economic, it will be able to compete with and displace new gas combustion turbines installed to meet peak demand. Beyond 2022, storage was found to be more cost effective than a simple cycle gas-fired peaking plant for meeting Minnesota’s capacity needs.

Connexus, Minnesota’s largest distribution cooperative, was a participant in the workshops and is already pursuing procurement of a 20MW, 40MWh energy-storage system. It will be one of largest storage projects of its kind in the Midwest. According to Connexus, responses to its Request for Proposals have been encouraging, with prices even more competitive than anticipated.

“We have been assessing energy storage to understand its potential benefits to our distribution system and members. Just like solar PV, with continuing drop in storage pricing, it is now becoming cost effective in specific applications,” said Brian Burandt, Vice President of Power Supply and Business Development at Connexus. “While we expect broad applications will be enabled with ongoing cost reductions and performance enhancements, we believe the technology is ready today for application on our system. That will save our member-owners and Minnesotans on electric costs, but in tandem, facilitate renewable energy growth to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

## Solar + batteries prepping to take over 10GW of US natural gas peaker power plant market

https://electrek.co/2017/12/13/solar-batteries-to-take-10gw-natural-gas/

Solar power and energy storage (batteries) have fallen in price enough that they’re now competing with the cost of natural gas peaker plants in specific markets. New analysis is suggesting 10GW of natural gas peaker plants are at risk through 2027 in the USA specifically.


Other, more aggressive suggestions don’t see a place for gas peaker plants after 2020 in the USA. It seems the age of the renewable energy plus energy storage power plant is upon us.

Part of the use of Tesla’s 100MW/129MWh project is an example of this in the real world. So is the collection of projects in California that partially replaced the natural gas plant at Aliso Canyon (which Tesla also participated in). Elsewhere in California there are discussions to replace two additional peaker plants in the near future, and one large gas power plant, that regulators say are systemically important to the grid with batteries.

The two Tesla battery power plants – and peaker plants in general – are participating in an electricity market that pays for filling gaps with fast response time electricity during times when electricity demand changes (like in California as the sun goes down and everyone goes home).

Major CEOs of power companies have also suggested, in a much more aggressive time frame, that peaker plants will go away entirely by 2020 in the USA.

What matters though is that energy storage is going to become a big player in the utility-scale peaker plant market – and we’ve already crossed a tipping point. A tipping point where the energy storage projects that are already planned are enough to build factories that will deliver to us the learning curves that will lower the pricing even further, allowing energy storage to take over bigger markets.

## Garnaut slams AEMC move to delay 5-minute settlement switch

http://reneweconomy.com.au/garnaut-slams-aemc-move-to-delay-5-minute-settlement-switch-89819/

The Australian Energy Market Commission has finally agreed to recommend a new rule that would change the  settlement period for the electricity spot price from 30 minutes to five minutes – a development that could underpin massive investment in battery storage in Australia.

But its decision to put off the implementation of the 5-minute until July, 2021 – at the earliest – has been slammed by leading experts, who say the decision will simply reinforce the position of the fossil fuel generators currently fleecing wholesale energy markets, and delay the entry of new technologies,


Numerous battery storage projects are ready to be implemented, but most need the extra income that could be gained from a change to the 5-minute rule to make the projects viable and increase the “value stack” of the product.

Some battery storage projects – such as the Tesla big battery in South Australia and another 30MW storage facility in the same state – are both being supported by federal or state payments, and are focused more on providing grid security services.

after huge resistance from the fossil fuel generators, who have used the 30-minute settlement system to manipulate pricing over the last 10 years.
