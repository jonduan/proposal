Course Outline and Schedule



Section 1: Introduction



Meet the instructors and learn what the course is all about. Take pre-course surveys to learn where you’re strongest and weakest, and if you have any commonly-held misconceptions.

Section 2: Energy Overview



Forms of energy, common units, and unit conversions. How energy flows through modern economies, including the composition of energy supply, common energy transformations (e.g. electricity generation) and which energy sources are used for which purposes. Prices for energy around the world, including recent and historical trends. Some historical context on the growth of energy use over time and major transitions, e.g. from biomass (crop and timber) dominated societies to coal-dominated to oil-dominated.

Section 3: Estimating Costs



This section covers the quantitative techniques at the heart of the course: levelized cost and cost of mitigation. We’ll apply these techniques to energy systems and also to everyday life.

Section 4: Environmental Impacts



Why do we focus on air pollution, climate change, and land use as the main impacts of the energy system? How severe are each of these impacts today, and how severe are they likely to be in the future given different possible human choices? How do they affect human health, GDP, and the natural world? You’ll synthesize this information by writing a letter to a policy maker about these environmental impacts and how much you think we should spend to mitigate them.

Sections 1-4 will be available as soon as the course opens. Sections 5-10 will be added later on, one at a time.

Section 5: Fossil Fuels



An abbreviated section focused on the abundance of fossil fuels. Spoiler alert: we won’t run out any time soon.

Section 6: The Electric Grid


A brief overview of modern electric grids including major technologies they use, how remarkably reliable and efficient they are, how they’re planned and regulated, and how they’re starting to change.

Section 7: Solar Power



Why solar is the most scalable renewable resource. Which solar power technologies dominate today and which have a chance to in the near future. How to estimate the cost of solar power in different regions, how it compares to other options, and the remarkable decline in its cost in the past 5 years. How we can cope with the intermittent nature of the solar resource. How solar power is regulated and subsidized today.

Section 8: Nuclear Power



The scalability of nuclear power and why we consider it the second major energy resource for humanity. How nuclear fission works and how it’s harnessed in modern nuclear plants. How much nuclear power costs and how much it’s used, including the stagnation in its use since the 1990’s and the prospects for its revival. Details on the hazards and costs of nuclear waste and power plant accidents. The connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. You’ll end this section by reading several prominent articles for and against nuclear power and writing your own essay.

Section 9: Demand Reduction and Efficiency



Reducing energy demand, by changing behavior or making devices more efficient, can reduce environmental harms – sometimes while saving money! But are there limits to this strategy? Can humanity reduce demand and aim towards a lower-energy future?

Section 10: Conclusion



Wrap-up and review.


## Introduction >> Background Questions


Food Calories (capital-C) are equal to 1000 regular calories.

converting energy units from calorie to watt second
1 cal = 4.1868 Ws

Each calorie is 4.18 joules of energy. 600 food calories becomes 600,000 regular calories, which is 2,508,000 joules of energy. If we consume this over 600 seconds, the rate of consumption is 4,180 watts.

1ac= 4046.856m²

$$\frac{10 \ acres}{1 \ year} \cdot \frac{1 \ year}{365 \ days} \cdot \frac{4046.86 \ m^2}{1 \ acre} =  110.9 \ m^2 / day$$

Humanity used 160,000 Terawatt-hours of energy in 2015. If there are 7.4 billion people on earth and 8766 hours per year, how many Watts did each person use on average?

Watts/person
$$160000 \ TW \cdot hours \cdot \frac{10^{12} \ Watts}{1 \ TW} \cdot \frac{1}{7.4 \times 10^{9} \ people \cdot 8766 \ hours }  = 2500 Watts / person$$


Which particles have about the same mass? 
Proton
Neutron

Which particles appear in equal numbers in all uncharged atoms? 

Proton

Electron

Protons and neutrons are very similar in mass; electrons are about 2000 times lighter than either of them. Uncharged atoms have equal numbers of protons and electrons. Heavier atoms generally have a greater number of neutrons than protons.
 
**Electric Grid Efficiency**

What is the average efficiency of electric grids in developed countries? That is, what percentage of the electrical power generated at power plants actually makes it to end users in countries like Australia, the UK, and the US?

94%



**Coal Power Efficiency**

What is the efficiency of a typical coal-fired power plant? That is, what percentage of the thermal energy from burning the coal is successfully turned into electricity?

Around 35%

**First Climate Change Treaty**


In what year did the first global treaty regarding climate change enter into force? Please answer with a number, e.g. '2016'



It's hard to estimate premature deaths from energy-related water pollution, but as we'll discuss later in the course it's almost certainly less than 100,000 per year, if not far less. Water pollution is a serious problem, but most mortality is from water-borne diseases causing diarrhea.
Energy-related air pollution is much worse, causing approximately 7 million premature deaths each year. Roughly half are from indoor cooking fires (especially in Africa and Asia), and the other half are from power plants and vehicles.
Attributing deaths to climate change is difficult, but it currently causes very few deaths per year. By 2050, the World Health Organization estimates it will cause a few hundred thousand premature deaths per year.


It will only take a few days for most of the air pollution to fall out of the atmosphere and stop affecting peoples' lungs and cardiovascular systems. There is some residual mortality that would last longer. However, carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for much longer, and the resulting temperature change will be with us for thousands of years.




In early 2016 oil prices are around $35/barrel, and since there are ~6.1 GJ of energy in 1 barrel of oil, it costs $5.7/GJ. Natural gas costs $2.5/MMBTU, which translates to $2.5/GJ, about half the price of oil. Coal costs only $1.6/GJ in the US, 1/4 the price of oil, though it has the largest regional variations. Electricity for large industrial customers is around $.07/kWh on average, which translates to $20/GJ, much higher than oil, and it's much higher yet in some areas with high electricity prices. Electricity for home consumers is usually significantly higher than for industrial customers, around $.13/kWh on average, which is $36/GJ, dramatically more expensive than oil (but more useful - electricity for a lightbulb is much more convenient than burning oil for light).
These relationships were qualitatively the same when oil and gas prices were much higher before the 2014 crash (~$100/barrel and ~$5/MMBTU), with the main exception being that electricity for industrial customers was comparable to the price of oil rather than being much higher.



About four fifths (80%) of total energy appropriated by humans is from fossil fuels. The next highest source is nuclear energy at 7%. Fossil's portion of human energy supply has fallen slightly in recent decades (down from 90% in the 1970's) thanks to the growth of renewables. But it is still dramatically higher than all of human history before 1850, when close to 100% human energy was from biomass.


Fossil fuels first overtook biomass (mostly trees and crops) as England's primary energy source around the year 1900, which you may find surprisingly recent.

##### Energy Overview > Introduction and the Units of Energy > Units and Conversions

A quick note on "heating values."  Fossil fuels contain some water, and whenever they're combusted some of the released energy is used to turn that water into steam (and thus isn't available to power an engine or generator).  Advanced combustion systems can capture that steam and condense it back to water, capturing the lost energy and getting close to 100% of the available energy from combustion.  Simpler combustion systems don't do this, and thus lose ~5-10% of the available energy.  So when listing the heat of combustion for fossil fuels (amount of energy released from combustion), most sources will list a "lower heating value" for simple systems without condensers, and "higher heating values" for systems with condensers.  In this course we generally use HHV's, since most power plants and large industrial energy infrastructure use condensers (and they're even becoming common on home furnaces).

Gas vs. Coal

In the US in 2016, coal costs $1.6/MMBTU (1 MMBTU = 1,000,000 BTU) and gas costs $.2/therm. Which is cheaper?

Coal is cheaper. It costs = $1.5/GJ, while gas costs = $1.9/GJ.


$$\frac{$1.6}{1 \ MMBTU} \cdot \frac{0.947817 \ MMBTU}{1 \ GJ} = $1.51 \ per \ GJ$$


$$\frac{$0.2}{1 \ therm} \cdot \frac{9.48043 \ therms}{1 \ GJ} = $1.90 \ per \ GJ$$




Electricity costs $.2/kWh and natural gas costs $12/MMBTU for residential consumers in Massachusetts, where David and Daniel live.
Which is cheaper on an energy basis?

Gas is cheaper. It costs = $11/GJ, while electricity costs = $56/GJ.


$$\frac{$0.2}{1 \ kWh} \cdot \frac{277.778 \ kWh}{1 \ GJ} = $56 \ per \ GJ$$



$$\frac{$12}{1 \ MMBTU} \cdot \frac{0.947817 \ MMBTU}{1 \ GJ} = $11 \ per \ GJ$$



The International Energy Agency says Russia used ~60,000 PJ (Petajoules) of primary energy in 2013. The Energy Information Administration says the US used 98 Quadrillion BTU of primary energy in that same year. Which country used more energy? 


The US did. Russia used 60 Exajoules; the US used 103 Exajoules.

$$60,000 \ PJ \cdot \frac{1 \ EJ}{1000 \ PJ} = 60 EJ$$

$$60,000 \ PJ \cdot \frac{1 \ EJ}{1000 \ PJ} = 60 EJ$$
