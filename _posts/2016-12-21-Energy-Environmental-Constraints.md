**Course Content**

 - Details of solar and nuclear power
 - Environmental impacts including climate change, air pollution, and land use
 - The flow of energy through modern economies, including costs
 - Lots of details about real world devices, e.g. the performance and cost of modern commercial solar panels
 - How to critically compare energy options, using good references and combining quantitative and qualitative analysis


Course Outline and Schedule



Section 1: Introduction



Meet the instructors and learn what the course is all about. Take pre-course surveys to learn where you’re strongest and weakest, and if you have any commonly-held misconceptions.

Section 2: Energy Overview



Forms of energy, common units, and unit conversions. How energy flows through modern economies, including the composition of energy supply, common energy transformations (e.g. electricity generation) and which energy sources are used for which purposes. Prices for energy around the world, including recent and historical trends. Some historical context on the growth of energy use over time and major transitions, e.g. from biomass (crop and timber) dominated societies to coal-dominated to oil-dominated.

Section 3: Estimating Costs



This section covers the quantitative techniques at the heart of the course: levelized cost and cost of mitigation. We’ll apply these techniques to energy systems and also to everyday life.

Section 4: Environmental Impacts



Why do we focus on air pollution, climate change, and land use as the main impacts of the energy system? How severe are each of these impacts today, and how severe are they likely to be in the future given different possible human choices? How do they affect human health, GDP, and the natural world? You’ll synthesize this information by writing a letter to a policy maker about these environmental impacts and how much you think we should spend to mitigate them.

Sections 1-4 will be available as soon as the course opens. Sections 5-10 will be added later on, one at a time.

Section 5: Fossil Fuels



An abbreviated section focused on the abundance of fossil fuels. Spoiler alert: we won’t run out any time soon.

Section 6: The Electric Grid


A brief overview of modern electric grids including major technologies they use, how remarkably reliable and efficient they are, how they’re planned and regulated, and how they’re starting to change.

Section 7: Solar Power



Why solar is the most scalable renewable resource. Which solar power technologies dominate today and which have a chance to in the near future. How to estimate the cost of solar power in different regions, how it compares to other options, and the remarkable decline in its cost in the past 5 years. How we can cope with the intermittent nature of the solar resource. How solar power is regulated and subsidized today.

Section 8: Nuclear Power



The scalability of nuclear power and why we consider it the second major energy resource for humanity. How nuclear fission works and how it’s harnessed in modern nuclear plants. How much nuclear power costs and how much it’s used, including the stagnation in its use since the 1990’s and the prospects for its revival. Details on the hazards and costs of nuclear waste and power plant accidents. The connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. You’ll end this section by reading several prominent articles for and against nuclear power and writing your own essay.

Section 9: Demand Reduction and Efficiency



Reducing energy demand, by changing behavior or making devices more efficient, can reduce environmental harms – sometimes while saving money! But are there limits to this strategy? Can humanity reduce demand and aim towards a lower-energy future?

Section 10: Conclusion



Wrap-up and review.

Some important topics we exclude.

We hope to cover many of these in a future, expanded version of the course: details on fossil fuels and the electric grid; details on end uses (transportation, buildings, industry); carbon capture and storage; biofuels; renewables other than solar (wind, hydro, etc.)
