## A Solar Feed-in Credit helps to deploy solar at home?

 [Markdown](https://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/happiness-post-solar-electricity-bill-farewell-2017/). 

“In total, I had exported almost 1,640kWh over 87 days – or about 19kWh per day. Electricity retailers do not show you on your bill how much of the solar energy you supplied to yourself (your ‘self-consumed’ solar energy is ‘behind the meter’) – only what they measure coming out of your house (the export).”

“the solar energy flows first into my house to power any appliances/devices that happen to be on, and only passes through to the grid if there’s excess available.”

"Grid energy purchase data for my home over the last billing period: Each row in the ‘heat map’ table above represents a day in the 87 day billing cycle, while each column represents a half-hour block of time during that day.

Cells in green signify that we drew no electricity from the grid, while yellow cells signify grid purchase amounts less than 1kWh. Anything over 1kWh in a half-hour period is coloured red.

It’s interesting to observe that the red ‘high consumption’ cells start to disappear towards the end of September – right about the time the average temperatures got high enough to obviate the need for heating (using either ducted AC or oil heaters)."


4.4kW solar system(s),
solar output 19kWh/day,
ssuming 6 peak sun hours per day and a conservative efficiency rate of 75%

Solar energy export (feed-in) data from my home over the last billing period: Each row in the ‘heat map’ table above represents a day in the 87 day billing cycle, while each column represents a half-hour block of time during that day.

The darker green the cell, the more energy exported, while orange cells represent lower export amounts. Grey cells indicate zero export.
