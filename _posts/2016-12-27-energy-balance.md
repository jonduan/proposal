Sankey diagram for the world in 2014
http://www.iea.org/sankey/#?c=World&s=Balance

## Sankey Diagram 

Here's a Sankey diagram for the world in 2013, from an interactive tool freely available from the International Energy Agency. This is a great source for looking up the energy supplies and uses in different countries and regions since the 1970's. It has some important differences from the LLNL Sankey; for example, it shows imports and exports, shows the transformation of oil in refineries, and lumps residential and commercial energy use together as "Other." It uses units of "Million tons of oil equivalent" ("Mtoe") and petajoules. At the bottom you can see options to scroll through different years and look look at different graph types, like line graphs of some of the individual flows to easily visualize them over time. These diagrams do not use the "factor of 3" accounting that we discussed in the video and that is used in the LLNL diagram above, so the amount of energy flowing into electricity generation from renewables like wind and solar is equal to the actual amount of electricity they generate.

Again, you can click on the image to view a larger version, or on the link above to get an interactive version.

Figure 2. This Sankey diagram of the world's energy system in 2013 shows the flow of energy from initial resources like petroleum and coal, through conversions like electricity generation, and to end users, which are divided into three major sectors. Source: IEA.



####### Coal for Electricity Around the World

Did coal's fraction of energy supplied for world electricity generation increase or decrease from 1990 until 2013? You can click on the "Power Station" box to see the composition of inputs to electricity generation.

Increase


The change was from 41% to 49%, which is about a one-fifth increase.


#### Japanese Coal Production

Japan's coal mining industry has waned in recent decades after being unable to compete with cheap coal imports, to the point that the IEA's tool shows no local production in 2013 (though there is in fact a small amount). Scroll through the years 1973-2013 for Japan using the slider on the bottom of the page. You will see a steady decline in local coal production. What percentage of Japan's total coal supply came from local production in 1973?
 

###### World Electricity Growth

How much did world electricity generation grow from 1990 to 2013? Look at the actual generation coming out of the power plants on the diagram.

The change was from 1017 Mtoe to 2006 Mtoe, so the amount roughly doubled.
