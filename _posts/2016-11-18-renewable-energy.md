**How much renewable energy could we generate?**

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. To make the transition from non-renewable energy like fossil fuels to renewable energy it is essential that we know what the potential is of these renewable sources. We will take a look at the most important sources and the physics behind it to calculate the potential of each source.
