The next few decades will herald a global change in energy production. The age of renewables requires more than just photovoltaics and windmills: it needs storage systems in an unprecedented volume. However, conventional techniques of storage fail due to the high investments or the low efficiency. This appears to be a stumbling block for the desired change to renewable energy.

His proposed hydraulic hydro storage system gives us a chance to store thousands of GWh at low cost and low environmental impact. The simple yet riveting idea is to lift a rock the size of a soccer stadium using established technologies thereby storing energy. Due to the fact that underground rocks are practically unlimited, the global change to solar power can continue.

# Renewable Energy Generation

**How much renewable energy could we generate?**

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. To make the transition from non-renewable energy like fossil fuels to renewable energy it is essential that we know what the potential is of these renewable sources. We will take a look at the most important sources and the physics behind it to calculate the potential of each source.


----------
## 2.1 Hydroelectricity


**Hydroelectricity** is the biggest contributor of sustainable electricity. How much energy can a hydro dam produce? What is the power density of hydroelectricity and what are the pros and cons.

The Three Gorges Dam

Hydroelectricity has currently a significant contribution to the renewable energy production in China. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in China that spans the Yangtze River by the town Sandouping.

The nominal water level in the reservoir is 80 meters higher than the river level down stream.
The nominal water handling of the Dam is 75⋅106 liters/s.
The mass density of water is 1000 kg/m3.
The gravity constant is g = 10 m/s2.
The effective potential-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency is assumed at C=37.5 %.


the nominal power of Three Gorger Dam expressed in GW. (Give your answer rounded off to one decimal. Format example: 98.7)

Explanation


Water energy per cubic meter: m*g*h=1000 (kg) * 10 (m/s²)* 80 (m) =0.8 (MJ\m³).


liters per second to cubic meters per second: 75*10⁶ (liters/s) = 75*10³ (m³/s) .


Power = efficiency * potential energy per second: 0.375 * 75*10³ (m³/s)* 0.8*10⁶ (J/m³) = 22.5 GW

--------

The Dam has a capacity factor of 0.45 or 45%. 

The total annual hydroelectricity produced in China is: 616 TWh.



How many dams (rounded to whole numbers) with the same capacity as the Three Gorger Dam are needed to produce the Chinese annual total electricity generation of 616 TWh? (Give your answer rounded off to units.)

Annual energy dam: 0.45 *365*24 (hour) * 22.5*10⁹ (W) = 88.7 TWh


616/88.7= 7 dams.


Average precipitation per year: 125 cm.

Inhabitants: 1,357,000,000 persons.

Land area: 9,330,000 km².


Calculate the percentage of land area of China that is required to collect the amount of rain water which is utilized by the Three Gorges Dam.

Give your answer as a percentage. Round off your answer to the nearest whole percent.


Explanation

Volume per year: 75*10³ (m³/s) * 3600*24*365 (s) * 0.45 = 1.06*10^12 (m³)

Area per year: 1.06*10^12 (m³) / 1.25 (m) = 0.851*10¹² (m²) = 0.851*10⁶ (km²)

Fraction total land area: 0.851 *10⁶ (km²) /9.33*10⁶ (km²) 2 = 9.135%.

or forgetting the capacity factor incorrectly:

9.135%/0.45=20.3%

### Wind energy potential in Japan

In this exercise only shallow offshore wind will be considered (due to the high Japanese population density). The coast-line in Japan is rather steep. For distances larger than 2 km out of the coastline, the depth of the Pacific and Japanese Sea, is on average deeper than 25 meters. This we will consider unsuitable for affordable construction of wind turbines. 

The figure below shows a map with the averaged wind speeds around Japan.

The Japanese coast-line as depicted in the figure has a total length of 5700 km. 
Consider that 30% of the Japanese coast-line would be covered with shallow offshore wind farms. 
The wind turbines have a conversion efficiency of C=50%. 
Inhabitants of Japan: 127 million
In this exercise we do not take the indeterminacy of wind energy into account. So this means that we assume that all energy that is produced can be consumed immediately and there is no mismatch in demand and supply of electricity so storage will not be needed.

#### 

What is the total land area for installation of wind farms expressed in km², considering that only 30% of the Japanese coast-line suitable for shallow offshore wind farms.

Explanation

Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,

width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,

Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²


The wind power per land area (m²) generated P is expressed by the following equation:

windpower per area

where ρ is the mass density of the air (=1.3 kg/m3), C is the conversion efficiency of the windturbine, and v is the averaged wind speed. 


Using the windmap, we estimate that the average windspeed is v = 6 m/s.

How much windpower can be collected per m² of shallow water in Japan?

Explanation
conversion factor C = 0.5

density = 1.3 kgm-3

From the map we estimate that v= 6 m/s.

filling in formula gives 2.205 W/m²

other answers use v= 4.5 , 5 or 7 m/s
