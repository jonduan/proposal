The next few decades will herald a global change in energy production. The age of renewables requires more than just photovoltaics and windmills: it needs storage systems in an unprecedented volume. However, conventional techniques of storage fail due to the high investments or the low efficiency. This appears to be a stumbling block for the desired change to renewable energy.

His proposed hydraulic hydro storage system gives us a chance to store thousands of GWh at low cost and low environmental impact. The simple yet riveting idea is to lift a rock the size of a soccer stadium using established technologies thereby storing energy. Due to the fact that underground rocks are practically unlimited, the global change to solar power can continue.

Unusually high winds allowed Denmark to meet all of its electricity needs – with plenty to spare for Germany, Norway and Sweden too](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/denmark-wind-windfarm-power-exceed-electricity-demand)

So much power was produced by Denmark’s windfarms on Thursday that the country was able to meet its domestic electricity demand and export power to Norway, Germany and Sweden.

On an unusually windy day, Denmark found itself producing 116% of its national electricity needs from wind turbines yesterday evening. By 3am on Friday, when electricity demand dropped, that figure had risen to 140%.

power potential of low carbon electricity resources

![](https://studio.edx.org/asset-v1:HarvardX+ENGSCI137x+2T2016+type@asset+block@Figure_8_power_potential.png)

David discussed this figure in the video, but it's complicated and worth treating in a bit more depth. It shows the power we could get from various low-carbon sources, either with no constraint on land use or with some constraints (1% or 10% of the land surface of the earth). The dashed green line shows our current power consumption, 18 TW, which comes from an energy system that uses approximately 1% of the land surface. As we discuss in several places in the course, only solar and nuclear power can comfortably provide current levels of primary energy without a substantial expansion of land use.

Note the lack of a physical maximum for nuclear power; since it involves "burning" fuel, we could choose different burn rates for different power levels, meaning there is no one physical maximum. Further note the black arrows on solar PV and nuclear, which indicate estimates that are or could be much higher than shown here. For solar PV, the physical maximum is in the 10's of thousands of TW (see notes below), well off this scale. For nuclear power, we assume a very conservative 100 W/m2, meaning that the power potentials here are at the very lower end of the justifiable range, and values fivefold higher than shown here are defensible.

Assumptions and notes:

Land area of earth: 1.49*1014 m2, Surface area of earth: 5.1*1014 m2

Solar:

Land constraint numbers assume 10W/m2, based on the upper ends of Smil (2015), Hernandez (2014), McKay (2013). While some current solar farms exceed 15 Wm2, the do so only with excellent solar resource, it would be hard to exceed 10 W/m2 as a global average of solar PV systems distributed widely near energy loads.

Physical maximum is very high; (surface area of earth)*(175 W/m2 avg. insolation)*20% efficiency gives 18000 TW, could even use 40% efficiency (multijunction cells) for 36000 TW

Wind:

Land use constraint numbers assume 1 W/m2. Physical maximum has been debated heavily, but the consensus is around 250 TW for land-based installations. We ignore flying wind turbines, which could bring the total over 500 TW. See Miller (2015) and Adams and Keith (2013)

Biomass:

Land use constraint numbers assume .5 W/m2 based on Smil (2015) and Daniel's own estimates of Miscanthus

Physical maximum of 25 TW from Field (1998) and Moriarty (2012) assuming 25% efficient conversion of biomass into electricity (including losses from collection, processing, and heat-to-electricity conversion)

Nuclear:

Land use constraint numbers assume 100 W/m2, based on the very low end of Smil (2015); looking at Smil's figures and published data on nuclear plants in the US, 500-1000 W/m2 seems most common, but we stick to a conservative figure for the large buildouts estimated here

No obvious physical maximum; since nuclear power involves "burning" a fixed resource, we could choose different burn rates to get different power levels, in principle could get near infinite power though it wouldn't last very long and would be expensive.

Hydro:

Physical maximum of 4.5 TW from Moriarty (2012) as the maximum resource capturable assuming near perfect capture of water from the highest possible points

Land use constraint figures actually show the maximum "technically extractable" resource from Moriarty (2012) and WEC (2013), as the maximum that could reasonably be extracted even with technological developments. Since hydro plants can only be deployed in certain locations, they likely would never even reach 1% of the land surface; most estimates of power density are around 1-5 W/m2, but using this for just 1% of the land surface gives 150 TW, well above the actually available resource.

Most energy storage methods, including batteries, are expensive and difficult to scale. Danielle Fong saw the opportunity to reinvent a classic technology - compressed air - to solve hi-tech energy problems. She developed a method to improve the efficiency of compressed air as an energy storage medium that could radically reduce cost and complexity.




BLOG: http://daniellefong.com/


Cofounder and chief scientist of LightSail Energy, Danielle Fong was featured in Forbes’ 30 under 30 list of people who aren’t waiting to reinvent the world in 2012. Fong dropped out of junior high school at age 12 to attend Dalhousie University, then dropped out of Princeton University’s Plasma Physics Department to start LightSail Energy. The company develops a form of compressed air energy storage, called ‘regenerative air energy storage’, which may be the missing link in the plan to make the world’s electrical grid green.

Danielle Fong is passionate about finding a solution to energy sustainability. "I have patience with people but not with systems" and her life choices proves this. With guidance and advice from fellow contemporary innovators like Steve Jobs she continued to follow her vision of finding the missing technology -something she instinctively felt- to conserve energy.

Self-described as ‘a girl from the future’, the 27-year-old Canadian innovator, entrepreneur and eco-pragmatist has been featured in Forbes' 30 under 30 in the category of Energy & Industry, as well as interviewed by Forbes.com in a video entitled "Danielle Fong May Save the World". She has also been named as one of the “Top 35 Innovators under 35” by the MIT Technology Review. Left junior high school at the age of 12 to attend Dalhousie University, graduated with first class honors in computer science and physics, then entered the Plasma Physics Department at Princeton University as a PhD student. She went on to co-found LightSail Energy, where she currently works as “Chief Science Officer” developing a form of compressed air energy storage. Danielle works actively to mentor and inspire entrepreneurship and invention in hard technology, working as a mentor.

**How much renewable energy could we generate?**

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. To make the transition from non-renewable energy like fossil fuels to renewable energy it is essential that we know what the potential is of these renewable sources. We will take a look at the most important sources and the physics behind it to calculate the potential of each source.


----------
## 2.1 Hydroelectricity


**Hydroelectricity** is the biggest contributor of sustainable electricity. How much energy can a hydro dam produce? What is the power density of hydroelectricity and what are the pros and cons.

### How to calculate the physical potential for Hydroelectricity

The Three Gorges Dam

Hydroelectricity has currently a significant contribution to the renewable energy production in China. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in China that spans the Yangtze River by the town Sandouping.

The nominal water level in the reservoir is 80 meters higher than the river level down stream.
The nominal water handling of the Dam is 75⋅106 liters/s.
The mass density of water is 1000 kg/m3.
The gravity constant is g = 10 m/s2.
The effective potential-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency is assumed at C=37.5 %.


the nominal power of Three Gorger Dam expressed in GW. (Give your answer rounded off to one decimal. Format example: 98.7)

Explanation


Water energy per cubic meter: m*g*h=1000 (kg) * 10 (m/s²)* 80 (m) =0.8 (MJ\m³).


liters per second to cubic meters per second: 75*10⁶ (liters/s) = 75*10³ (m³/s) .


Power = efficiency * potential energy per second: 0.375 * 75*10³ (m³/s)* 0.8*10⁶ (J/m³) = 22.5 GW

--------

The Dam has a capacity factor of 0.45 or 45%. 

The total annual hydroelectricity produced in China is: 616 TWh.



How many dams (rounded to whole numbers) with the same capacity as the Three Gorger Dam are needed to produce the Chinese annual total electricity generation of 616 TWh? (Give your answer rounded off to units.)

Annual energy dam: 0.45 *365*24 (hour) * 22.5*10⁹ (W) = 88.7 TWh


616/88.7= 7 dams.


Average precipitation per year: 125 cm.

Inhabitants: 1,357,000,000 persons.

Land area: 9,330,000 km².


Calculate the percentage of land area of China that is required to collect the amount of rain water which is utilized by the Three Gorges Dam.

Give your answer as a percentage. Round off your answer to the nearest whole percent.


Explanation

Volume per year: 75*10³ (m³/s) * 3600*24*365 (s) * 0.45 = 1.06*10^12 (m³)

Area per year: 1.06*10^12 (m³) / 1.25 (m) = 0.851*10¹² (m²) = 0.851*10⁶ (km²)

Fraction total land area: 0.851 *10⁶ (km²) /9.33*10⁶ (km²) 2 = 9.135%.

or forgetting the capacity factor incorrectly:

9.135%/0.45=20.3%

### Wind energy potential in Japan

In this exercise only shallow offshore wind will be considered (due to the high Japanese population density). The coast-line in Japan is rather steep. For distances larger than 2 km out of the coastline, the depth of the Pacific and Japanese Sea, is on average deeper than 25 meters. This we will consider unsuitable for affordable construction of wind turbines. 

The figure below shows a map with the averaged wind speeds around Japan.

The Japanese coast-line as depicted in the figure has a total length of 5700 km. 
Consider that 30% of the Japanese coast-line would be covered with shallow offshore wind farms. 
The wind turbines have a conversion efficiency of C=50%. 
Inhabitants of Japan: 127 million
In this exercise we do not take the indeterminacy of wind energy into account. So this means that we assume that all energy that is produced can be consumed immediately and there is no mismatch in demand and supply of electricity so storage will not be needed.

#### 

What is the total land area for installation of wind farms expressed in km², considering that only 30% of the Japanese coast-line suitable for shallow offshore wind farms.

Explanation

Length of suitable coast-line: 5700 (km) * 0.3 = 1710 km,

width of zone to put shallow offshore wind farms is 2 km,

Total area for wind farm is: 1710 (km) × 2 (km) = 3420 km²


The wind power per land area (m²) generated P is expressed by the following equation:

windpower per area

![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/6fd0a7b8349cfa6fb2674fe8c65f9ee0/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/windpower_per_area.png)

where ρ is the mass density of the air (=1.3 kg/m3), C is the conversion efficiency of the windturbine, and v is the averaged wind speed. 


Using the windmap, we estimate that the average windspeed is v = 6 m/s.

How much windpower can be collected per m² of shallow water in Japan?

Explanation
conversion factor C = 0.5

density = 1.3 kgm-3

From the map we estimate that v= 6 m/s.

filling in formula gives 2.205 W/m²

other answers use v= 4.5 , 5 or 7 m/s
