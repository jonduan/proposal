**How much renewable energy could we generate?**

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. To make the transition from non-renewable energy like fossil fuels to renewable energy it is essential that we know what the potential is of these renewable sources. We will take a look at the most important sources and the physics behind it to calculate the potential of each source.


----------
## 2.1 Hydroelectricity


**Hydroelectricity** is the biggest contributor of sustainable electricity. How much energy can a hydro dam produce? What is the power density of hydroelectricity and what are the pros and cons.

The Three Gorges Dam

Hydroelectricity has currently a significant contribution to the renewable energy production in China. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in China that spans the Yangtze River by the town Sandouping.

The nominal water level in the reservoir is 80 meters higher than the river level down stream.
The nominal water handling of the Dam is 75⋅106 liters/s.
The mass density of water is 1000 kg/m3.
The gravity constant is g = 10 m/s2.
The effective potential-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency is assumed at C=37.5 %.


the nominal power of Three Gorger Dam expressed in GW. (Give your answer rounded off to one decimal. Format example: 98.7)

Explanation


Water energy per cubic meter: m*g*h=1000 (kg) * 10 (m/s²)* 80 (m) =0.8 (MJ\m³).


liters per second to cubic meters per second: 75*10⁶ (liters/s) = 75*10³ (m³/s) .


Power = efficiency * potential energy per second: 0.375 * 75*10³ (m³/s)* 0.8*10⁶ (J/m³) = 22.5 GW

--------

The Dam has a capacity factor of 0.45 or 45%. 

The total annual hydroelectricity produced in China is: 616 TWh.



How many dams (rounded to whole numbers) with the same capacity as the Three Gorger Dam are needed to produce the Chinese annual total electricity generation of 616 TWh? (Give your answer rounded off to units.)

Annual energy dam: 0.45 *365*24 (hour) * 22.5*10⁹ (W) = 88.7 TWh


616/88.7= 7 dams.


Average precipitation per year: 125 cm.

Inhabitants: 1,357,000,000 persons.

Land area: 9,330,000 km².


Calculate the percentage of land area of China that is required to collect the amount of rain water which is utilized by the Three Gorges Dam.

Give your answer as a percentage. Round off your answer to the nearest whole percent.


Explanation

Volume per year: 75*10³ (m³/s) * 3600*24*365 (s) * 0.45 = 1.06*10^12 (m³)

Area per year: 1.06*10^12 (m³) / 1.25 (m) = 0.851*10¹² (m²) = 0.851*10⁶ (km²)

Fraction total land area: 0.851 *10⁶ (km²) /9.33*10⁶ (km²) 2 = 9.135%.

or forgetting the capacity factor incorrectly:

9.135%/0.45=20.3%



## Week 2: Renewable Energy Generation > 2.2 Wind energy > Lecture


Wind Energy is one of the biggest contributors of renewable energy and can be used in many places.

How much energy can a wind turbine produce? What is the power density of wind energy? 

Global  installed capacity:283GW


Global producAon: 521 TWh

0.19 kWh/person/day 0.07 Units

2.3% of total electricity demand
