## IMFx: ESRx Energy Subsidy Reform

[IMFx: ESRx Energy Subsidy Reform](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IMFx+ESRx+1T2017/courseware/9f54fcdac1d4465e803a45148d4f0fd5/e3d83ded298b427c92abf245978eaa05/?child=first). 



**Subsidies** can be in the form of are transfers from a government to an individual or group. Some subsidies such as those benefitting producers (input subsidy or tax subsidy) may not necessarily translate in retail prices of energy products being below the supply cost. In a perfectly competitive market with no government intervention, subsidies would not exist.

Country X is an oil producer and exporter. It has also a well-developed oil refining industry that provides all the needs of gasoline in the domestic market. Given the low cost of oil extraction ($US10 per barrel), the cost of producing gasoline is well below international market prices. Which of the following statements on the adequate benchmark price for the supply cost to determine whether there is a case of fuel subsidy is correct?

The supply cost corresponds to the international price of gasoline

Since gasoline is an internationally traded good, the supply cost corresponds to its international price. The supply cost should reflect the opportunity cost stemming from the revenues foregone by selling gasoline at below market price.


A pre-tax subsidy arises whenever the retail price to consumers is below than the supply cost.



 A post-tax subsidy occurs when taxes fail to take into account the negative externalities related to energy products (corrective taxes).
 
 
 
 Post-tax subsidies are larger than pre-tax subsidies given that they are the sum of pre-tax subsidies and tax subsidies.
