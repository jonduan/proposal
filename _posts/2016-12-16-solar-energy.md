#### Week 6: Solar Energy > Intro - Solar Energy > Welcome to week 6
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016/courseware/7bd261cdd99948168de61c0b530ec83c/9e97e68a218c41a398556d754113f484/

an overview of PhotoVoltaics (PV). 

What is the status of the market of PV-technology? How does a PV-cell work and what are important components and design rules to design a PhotoVoltaic System?

the production and installations of solar energy around the world and over time.

how is solar doing compared to other renewable's? How cheap is solar at the moment and how will it evolve in the future?


Most installed solar capacity is based on: Multi crystalline solar cells

Most of the solar cell production was located in Japan in 2005 and in China and Taiwan in 2015.

Nowadays the non-module costs in a systems are simular to module costs.
The price of PV modules has dropped drastically the last decades.

The price of a PV system nowadays is about 1€/Wp.

when a crystalline solar module is more efficient it means it needs less module area to produce the same amount of electricity. Less module area means less modules, less racking, less wiring and less installation costs.


Solar has the least installed capacity and lowest capacity factor and has the highest capacity growth.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.2 How does a PV cell work?


All solar cells are based on the same principle the Photo-voltaic effect.


Longyangxia Dam Solar Park
Installed capacity: 850 MWp


**PN-junction**

In n-type materials the electrons are the dominant charge carrier and in p-type the holes are. Electrons are collected at the n-type layer and holes at the p-type layer.

the following circuits represents the equivalent circuit of an ideal solar cell under illumination

An ideal solar cell under illumination can be represented by a current source in parallel with a diode. The current source symbolizes the photogenerated current, and it is opposite to the forward current of the diode.


In an IV curve of a solar cell the voltage is always at its maximum when the current is zero.

In an IV curve of a solar cell the current is always at its maximum when the voltage is zero.

The optimal operation power of a solar cell is calculated by multipling the Vmpp with the Impp.


Calculate the maximum power (in W and three decimals) of a solar cell having current and voltage values of Impp = 3.5 A and Vmpp = 0.75 V, respectivily, at maximum power point.

###### WATT-PEAK AND EFFICIENCY

Two definitions explained in the video are the watt-peak and efficiency. As an example we consider a solar module with a surface of 1.5m2 with a power output 300Wp. Watt-peak is the power generated by a module or a device under Standard Test Conditions. Standard Test Conditions correspond to light irradiance of 1000Wm−2 with a spectral shape equal to AM1.5 spectrum. So under STC conditions the module would give a power of 300W. 

The efficiency is the fraction of solar energy converted into electrical energy, under STC. The efficiency of a solar cell is given by:
$$Efficiency=\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$$
Efficiency=Pout/Pin
So the above panel has an efficiency of:  20 %.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.3 PV technologies

the current existing PV technologies and see how they are developing.

What are the differences between thin film, crystalline silicon and III-V solar cells? What are multijunction solar cells? Can we make PV modules flexible and what can we expect from organic and perovskites based solar cells? 




In general solar cell efficiency records are higher at smaller scale

Multi-junction III-V solar cells can achieve the highest efficiencies

Thin film solar cells have efficiencies between 12-22%
Although Perovskites have a lot of potential and a high intial efficiency on small scale they are still not 'better' than thin film silicon cells because they degrade after a short period of time making their effiency a lot lower.


 the advantages of thin film solar cells compared to crystalline solar cells:
 
 - Thin film modules can be made flexible.

 - Less material is needed for the actual cell.

 - The non-modular system costs can be a lot cheaper.

reasons for people choose for mono-crystalline solar modules instead of multi-crystalline

 - They look better aesthetically.
 
 - The conversion efficiencies are often higher.
 - The non-module costs can be cheaper.
 
 
 
 - III-V solar cells are very expensive.
 - III-V solar cells are used in space applications.
 - III-V solar cell often use multiple junctions techniques.
 - III-V solar cells often make use materials that are not very abundant.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.4 PV system components 


The main components of a PV-system are, of course, solar cells.
how multiple solar cells are combined to form a module and what the considerations are on how to orientate them.


interconnecting solar cells to make a solar module. 

 - The use of bypass diodes in a solar module can help in reducing the undesired effects of a dysfunctional solar cell. The bypass diode is connected in parallel to a solar cell but with a polarity opposite to that of the solar cell.
 
 - The open-circuit voltage of a solar module with series connected solar cells is the sum of the open-circuit voltages of all the individual solar cells.
 
----
 In a series connection, the voltages of the individual components add up but the current through the components remains the same. 
 
 In a parallel connection, the currents of the individual components add up but the voltage across them remains the same. 
 
 Bypass diodes are connected across (in parallel to) a solar cell or a group of solar cells, but with a polarity opposite to that of the solar cell(s). The use of a bypass diode helps in bypassing one or multiple dysfunctional solar cell(s).
 
 
 We have identical crystalline silicon solar cells available, with a short-circuit current of 3.5 A and an open-circuit voltage of 0.7 V at STC. If a PV module is formed by 60 crystalline silicon solar cells in series, what is the open-circuit voltage of the module, in volts, at STC? Assume that the interconnection losses are negligible.
 
 If all the cells are in series, the voltage will be added to get the open-circuit voltage of the module.
Voc = 0.7V*60 = 42V

The short-circuit current of a solar module with all the solar cells in series is the same as the solar cell with the lowest current. At STC, that means that the short-circuit current will be 3.5 A.

-----
 A large crystalline silicon module consists of 54 cells. The open-circuit voltage of the module is 16.2 V. How are the cells connected in the module if the standard c-Si cell has an open circuit voltage of 0.6 V and short-circuit current of 3 A ?
 
 
 Two strings, each string consisting of 27 cells connected in series. Both these strings are connected to each other in parallel.
 
 
 If all the cells were connected in parallel, the currents would add up and the module voltage would be the same as the single-cell voltage. Therefore, we would measure a total voltage of 0.6V. If they were all in series, the voltage would add up, resulting in a total voltage of 54∗0.6=32.4V
However, it is easy to realize that 16.2V=32.4V2. This means that we have two strings, each one consisting of 54/2=27 cells connected in series. In each string, the voltage adds up, so that we have 27∗0.6V=16.2V, and the string current is the same as the single cell current (3A). When the two strings are connected in parallel with each other, the total voltage equals to the single string voltage 16.2V) and the total current is the sum of the two single string currents 3A+3A=6A.

A Solar enthousiast has a house in Ecuador and wants to place a PV system on it's roof. There is no shading of any trees or other surroundings. He can not change the orientation or tilt angle during the year.

What will be the optimal tilt angle?
 0°
What will be the optimal orientation?
It doesn't matter
Explanation
Ecuador is at the equator of the earth that means that the sun will go straight over the sky (or with an altitude of 90 degrees). To place solar modules horizontally (with a tilt of 0 degrees) will be best. The orientation doesn't matter if the modules are horizontal.


----
We will consider three locations: Vancouver, New Delhi and Buenos Aires. We want to install a solar system in these three locations at the adequate tilt and orientation. Please relate each location with the optimum tilt angle and orientation (North or South) of the given choices.
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/28fd6ce03d5f4e6b84a2bb847b125389/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/Location_scheme.png)


Explanation
The coordinates of the three places are:
Vancouver: 49º15'N
New Delhi: 28º36'N
Buenos Aires: 34º36'S
According to these, the first two locations should have the panels facing South, while Buenos Aires is in the southern hemisphere, and therefore the panels should be facing North there.
Once the orientation is fixed, the tilt must be calculated. The tilt is related to the latitude at which the site is located, meaning how close or how far these places are to the equator.
Since New Delhi is the closest to the equator, the seasonal variations will be minimized and the sun will strike more vertically than in the other locations. This gives us the lowest tilt angle, 20º.
The furthest location from the equator is Vancouver, and therefore, it will need the biggest tilt or 40º.
Buenos Aires has a latitude in between, of 34º36', and therefore the tilt angle needed will be in between also, namely 30º.
These angles and orientations also correspond with the ones explained in the video lecture.

PV panels

Batteries are usually used either in stand-alone PV systems or in hybrid systems. If the system is grid-connected, the extra energy produced will be pumped into the grid, and when the PV production is not enough to cover the demand, power is withdrawn from the grid. In such a case, we could say that the grid acts as a kind of storage, and therefore batteries are not needed anymore.

----
Calculate the maximum power (in W) of a PV module with 60 cells that all have current and voltage values of Impp = 7 A and Vmpp = 0.65 V, respectivily, at maximum power point.

Maximum power of 1 cell is: Impp * Vmpp = 7 (A) * 0.65 (V) = 4.55 W. It doesn't matter if the cells are in parallel or in series in both cases the maximum power of the module: 60 * 4.55 (W) = 273 W

----
the solar inverter topologies

Module level (micro)inverters ensure a higher yield than string inverters when there are partially shaded arrays.

Module level (micro)inverters are better suited to get the maximum power out of each PV module than compared to central inverters, especially when there are partially shaded arrays.


String inverters ensure a higher yield than central inverters when there are partially shaded arrays.

If the arrays are partially shaded, not all panels are under the same illumination. Under such a condition, maximum power can be extracted from the PV array if each panel is delivering maximum power pertaining to that illumination level. 

Module level inverters track the MPP for each panel, while string inverters track the MPP for each string, and the central inverters track the MPP for the whole array. 

Therefore, higher yields can be expected from module level inverter topology than string inverter topology; and higher yields can be expected from string inverter topology than central inverter topology.


----
requirement for an ideal solar inverter?


A very high conversion efficiency.

In-built MPP Tracking capability .
A high lifetime.
Detection and prevention capability against islanding.


an ideal solar inverter has MPPT capability, high efficiency, a high lifetime and anti-islanding capabilities.
Under grid failure, the PV system must stop feeding power into the grid, which may be dangerous to the utility workers and other appliances connected to the grid.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.6 Storage for PV-systems

If one wants to independent from the electricity grid (or simply doesn't have the choice) batteries for PV systems are the solution!

explain the characteristics of the batteries used in PV systems. Efficiency, Depth of Discharge and cycle life will be considered as well.

In case of PV systems, the intermittency of

Lithium-ion batteries

Explanation
Lithium-ion batteries have the highest gravimetric energy of all the technologies shown here. That means that it can store the maximum amount of power with minimum weight. Since the Nuna car is supposed to be a very fast car, they want the least extra weight possible, and that is the reason of choosing Lithium-ion batteries.


------
Consider a lead-acid battery with 90 Ah capacity and a rated voltage of 12 V.

What is the total capacity of energy in watt-hours that can be stored in the battery?
The energy capacity of the battery = voltage * capacity = 12 V * 90 Ah = 1080 Wh.

----
How much time in minutes will it take for the battery to go from 40% State of Charge (SOC) to 100% SOC, assuming the battery is fully charged in two hours? You may assume a linear rate of charging.

100% of the battery is charged in two hours. So 60% of the battery is charged in 60% * 2 hours = 72 minutes.

----

If the voltaic efficiency of the battery is 95%, and the coulombic efficiency of the battery is 80%, the roundtrip efficiency of storage in % for the battery is:

Overall efficiency or roundtrip efficiency = Voltaic efficiency * coulombic efficiency = 95%×80% = 76%.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.7 Central design rules for PV systems


the major considerations for designing your own PV system



how to choose the amount of modules in your system based on your electricity usage and tell you the inefficiencies of most components. The sizing of the Inverter, Charge controller and batteries will also be considered in the video.

-----
Family Smith has a small house in the country side which is not connected to the grid. The place enjoys 4 equivalent sun hours. Therefore, they have decided to install an off-grid PV system in the house to supply their electricity demand.

The house electricity needs are summarized in the table below.

Load	Quantity	Power per item (W)	Time of use (h)	Type
Light bulb	12	15	3	DC
TV	1	110	2	AC
DVD	1	30	2	AC
Laptop	1	80	4	AC
What is the total energy demand Wh?


The total energy demand can be calculated simply by multiplying the power of each component by the number of hours that it is going to be used.
E=12×15×3+1×110×2+1×30×2+1×80×4=1140Wh
What is the total power demanded by the DC loads in W?
The total DC power needed can be calculated by adding up all the power for the components using DC.
PDC=12×15=180W
What is the total power demanded by the AC loads in W?
The total AC power needed can be calculated by adding up all the power for the components using AC.
PAC=110+30+80=220W


he family is considering solar panels with the following specifications:

Power output = 100 Wp

Vmpp= 16 V

Impp = 6.25 A

Voc = 18 V

Isc = 7 A

Assume that the combined efficiency for the cables, the charge controller and the battery system is 90% and that of the inverter is 97%. How much energy in Wh must the panels produce to cover the electricity demand of the family Smith in one day?

The inverter efficiency is applied to the power needed for AC appliances:
EAC=((110+30)×2+80×4) / 0.97=619Wh
The DC appliances have the following energy need
EDC=12×15×3=540Wh
Then, the total energy needed in the panel side is calculated as follows:
Etotal=(619Wh+540Wh)/ 0.9=1288Wh


Assume the panels work under MPP conditions. How many panels will be needed to produce that energy?



The total power needed from the panels is calculated by dividing the total energy by the 4 equivalent sun hours:
Ptotal=1288Wh/4h=322W
Now, the number of panels needed to produce that energy taking into account the rated power output of the panels:
Numberofpanels=322W/100W=3.22panels
Since the number of panels needs to be an integer number (no decimals), the highest approximation is taken, in this case, 4 panels.
 
---
Now, since the system is not connected to the grid, the family Smith will also need some energy storage. They have specified that, since it is a weekend house, only 2 days of autonomy will be needed. In this case, batteries with the following specifications will be used:

Battery capacity = 120 Ah

Battery voltage = 12 V

Maximum allowed depth of discharge = 50%

The system is designed to use 24 V as operating voltage. What will be the minimum needed battery capacity in Ah?

The minimum battery capacity will be calculated using the total energy demand of 1288 Wh calculated in the question above:
Cbatt=1288Wh/(0.5×24V)×2days=214.7Ah
How many of the specified batteries will be needed?

The number of batteries in parallel must therefore provide that capacity. Since the available batteries have a capacity of 100 Ah:
Nparallel=214.7Ah/120Ah=1.79≈2
On the other hand, the number of batteries in series depends on the operational voltage, which is said to be 24 V. Since the battery voltage is 12 V:
Nseries=24V/12V=2
The total number of batteries is the multiplication of the number of batteries in series and in parallel, resulting in 4 batteries.



#### Week 6: Solar Energy > 6.8 Economics and Policies for PV systems 


the price of solar energy is dropping rapidly. What does this mean for new owners of PV systems? When will they have their investments payed back by the decrease in electricity bills?

Learn about the energy economic terms of grid parity and levelized cost of electricity for solar energy . Find out about the expected prices of solar energy in the future.



Payback period



----
LOCE 
The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be defined as the cost per kWh of electricity produced by a power generation project. It does not depend on the cost of electricity coming from the grid. In turn, it is used to compare the cost of electricity coming from the grid with the cost of the electricity coming from a PV system


Grid parity is achieved when the levelized cost of electricity is equal to the electricity cost at a particular location.

The achievement of grid parity depends on the insolation, the cost of PV systems, the discount rate and the cost of electricity coming from the grid at the particular location.

The levelized cost of electricity can be used to compare the electricity price coming from PV and from solar thermal energy.

The family Smith wants to install a grid-connected PV system on their rooftop.
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/ff8b0caa7ef1a8f0456490edd632bda4/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/huis_met_zonnepanelen.png)
multicrystalline PV modules on roof
Until now they have been using the grid electricity at €0.25/kWh, with an average annual consumption of around 3500 kWh. The PV system will cost them €5000 in total. The system is expected to have an annual yield of 3000 kWh.

What will the average annual savings of the family Smith in euros be if they install the above mentioned PV system? You may assume that any PV generated power sent to the grid offsets directly the consumption of the Smith household.


 750
 
Explanation
Since every kWh of PV generated energy is fed to the grid and it directly offsets the electricity consumption, the annual savings are the same as the amount of money equivalent to the PV generated energy. In this case, it is nothing but 

electricity costs×annual PV yield=€0.25/kWh×3000kWh=€750

Given the initial system costs, what will be the payback period of the PV system in years, assuming the grid costs remain the same. You may neglect the time value of money.

6.66
 
Explanation
Assuming no changes in grid costs and the value of money, the time needed for the PV system to payback its initial investment can be simply calculated as 
 

initial investmentyearly savings=€5000/€750/year=6.66years.

#### Week 6: Solar Energy > Pros & Cons: PV systems > Case 1: Multicrystalline or Amorphous Silicon?

Case 1: Multicrystalline or Amorphous Silicon?

The Visser Family is interested in buying a solar energy system. After some research on the Internet they have found two different systems that they are considering to install on their tilted roof. System A is a PV system based on multicrystalline silicon solar cells and system B is a PV system based on flexible thin film amorphous silicon solar cells.

multicrystalline PV modules on roof  

![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/8aae548b3162605d693964e95069c76a/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/poly_roof.jpg)




flexible solar modules
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/dfd34eb262f9c8b3a18aec6a6f7feb9c/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/flexible.JPG)



Both systems are grid-connected using a 900 Wp inverter. The total price of the inverter, the cables, amounts to €500. The solar modules are to be installed on a shed. The roof of the shed can only support 10 m² of solar modules.


System A: The efficiency of the multicrystalline silicon module amounts to 15%. The dimensions of the solar module are 0.5m by 1.0m. Each module has an output of 75 Wp. The modules cost €60 each. The installation costs are €500.

System B: The flexible thin film amorphous silicon solar modules have an efficiency of 6%. The dimensions of the solar modules amount to 0.5m by 1.0m. The output of each module is 30 Wp. The modules cost €20 each. Because the modules are flexible and can be mounted differently the installation costs are only €250. Another advantage of the amorphous silicon solar modules is that they perform better on cloudy days in which there is no direct sunlight. Installed in the Netherlands, this system gives, on a yearly basis, 10% more output per installed Wp than the multicrystalline silicon modules.

In the Netherlands a PV system having multicrystalline silicon module generates on average 850 Wh per Wp in one year. The performance of both types of modules is guaranteed for 20 years. The price of electricity from the grid is €0.23/kWh. Assume that all the power produced by the PV system is completely consumed by the Visser family.


**Maximum Power**

If the Visser family would only be interested in the (peak) power (in Wp) of their PV system, what would their choice be?
Hint: consider the peak power of the inverter and the area available on the shed.

Explanation
_system A:_
Since the inverter is able to handle 900Wp, the number of panels for system A will be calculated as:
900Wp/75Wp=12panels
Each panel is 0.5m2, so it will equal a total of 6m2 for all the panels, which considering the rooftop area of 10m2, it is possible to install 900Wp
_system B:_
Since the inverter is able to handle 900Wp, the number of panels for system B will be calculated as:
900Wp/30Wp=30panels
Each panel is 0.5m2, so it will equal a total of 15m2 for all the panels, which considering the rooftop area of 10m2, it is not possible. Therefore, the maximum possible peak power that can be installed will be determined by the rooftop area as:
10m2/0.5m2=20panels
20panels∗30Wp=600Wp


**€/kWh price**

If the Visser family would only be interested in the €/kWh price of their PV system, what would their choice be?
Hint: consider the peak power of the inverter and the area available on the shed.

Explanation
system A:
The total cost of the system will be:

Cost=12panels∗€60/panel+€500+€500=€1720
To calculate the price of electicity of the system, this cost will be divided by the total amount of energy that the system will produce in the 20 years of its lifetime:
Energy=900Wp∗850Wh/(Wpyear)∗20years=15,300,000Wh=15,300kWh

€1720/15,300kWh=€0.11/KWh
system B:
Explanation
The total cost of the system will be:

Cost=20panels∗€20/panel+€500+€250=€1150
To calculate the price of electicity of the system, this cost will be divided by the total amount of energy that the system will produce in the 20 years of its lifetime:
Energy=600Wp∗1.1∗850Wh/(Wpyear)∗20years=11,220,000Wh=11,220kWh

€1100/11,220kWh=€0.10/KWh

**Payback period**
 
Family Visser is eligible for a municipal subsidy for sustainable energy that amounts to 15% of the initial costs of the PV system.

Assume that the electricity price of €0.23/kWh does not change.

Using this subsidy, how many years do system A and B need to be operational to earn their own investment back?

Only considering the payback period For which system should they choose?

Explanation
system A:
The total cost of the system will be:
The total cost of the system including subsidies will be:

Cost=0.85∗(12panels∗€60/panel+€1000)=€1462
To calculate the time needed to earn the investment back, it can be calculated by calculating the energy produced per year, and the electricity cost that this electricity would imply if the system will not be installed. Such calculations assume that all the energy produced is used:
Energy=900Wp∗850Wh/(Wpyear)=765,000Wh/year=765kWh/year

Costelectricity=765kWh/year∗€0.23/kWh=€175.95/year
By dividing the total investment costs by the annual electricity costs, the payback time can be determined

Timepayback=€1462/€175.95/year=8.3years
system B:
Explanation
The total cost of the system including subsidies will be:

Cost=0.85∗(20panels∗€20/panel+€500+€250)=€977.5
To calculate the time needed to earn the investment back, it can be calculated by calculating the energy produced per year, and the electricity cost that this electricity would imply if the system will not be installed. Such calculations assume that all the energy produced is used
Energy=1.1∗600Wp∗850Wh/(Wpyear)=561,000Wh/year=561kWh/year

Costelectricity=561kWh/year∗€0.23/kWh=€129.03/year
By dividing the total investment costs by the annual electricity costs, the payback time can be determined:

Timepayback=€977.5€/129.03/year=7.57years

A transformation is happening in global energy markets that’s worth noting as 2016 comes to an end: solar power, for the first time, is becoming the cheapest form of new electricity.

This has happened in isolated projects in the past. An especially competitive auction in the Middle East, for example, resulted in record-cheap solar costs. But now unsubsidised solar is beginning to outcompete coal and natural gas on a larger scale, and notably, new solar projects in emerging markets are costing less to build than wind projects, according to fresh data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.






#### Solar vs Coal

Solar generated more electricity than coal in the UK for the first month on record in May.

Solar generated around 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricy in May, 50 per cent more than the 893GWh generated by coal, according to analysis by Carbon Brief.

Carbon brief had previously said that solar power beat two "largely symbolic" milestones in May when it beat coal for the first full day on April 9 and for the first week on May 3.



The day coal power dropped out of the national grid
The increase in solar-powered electricity comes as the amount of coal in the national grid fell to zero several times in May, thought to be the first time this had happened for more than 100 years.

Solar made up 6 per cent of the UK's electricity in May, while coal made up only 4 per cent. In January solar made up 1 per cent and coal 17 per cent.

#### Cost
1/26 Solar power becoming world's cheapest form of electricity production - Thursday December 15

Solar power is becoming the cheapest way to generate electricity, according to leading analysts.
 
 Data produced by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) showed the cost of solar in 58 lower-income countries – including China, Brazil and India – had fallen to about a third of levels in 2010 and was now slightly cheaper than wind energy.

#### Potential

Solar energy has by far the biggest energy potential and also is the fastest growing source of energy. Some of the questions we will answer with this video are: How much electricity can photovoltaic (PV) cells, solar thermal and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) towers produce? What is the power density of solar energy and what are the pros and cons.


### Solar energy in the USA.

Solar Energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the USA. In some states it has become competitive with other energy sources. In this excercise we will find out what the  potential for solar power is. The image below illustrates the average annual irradiation in the USA. You can immediately see the advantage the USA has over Germany in terms of solar energy yield.

###
Facts about the USA in 2016:

Mainland land area: 7,663,942 km²
Population: 319 million
Electricity consumption: 4087 TWh/year



What is the average solar power per area in the mainland of the USA (excluding Alaska) expressed in W/m²

1900 (kWh/m²/y) /365 (d) /24 (h) * 1000 = 217 W/m²;
Other answers are of 1700, 2100 and 2200 kWh/m²/y


the total solar irradiation in mainland USA expressed in TWh/year


How many times larger is the yearly solar irradiation in the mainland of the USA in reference to the total electricity consumption of the USA?


main land USA take average: =1900 kWh/m2/year
area times irradiation: 7,663,942 *10⁶ m² *1900 kWh/m2 = 14561490 TWh/year
Total ~ 14561490/4087 TWh/year is 3562.9 times electricity consumption/year.




Let's make an estimation on how much land is required to produce the electricity needs in the USA using Solar energy.


    The solar farms are uniformly distributed over the country.
    Assume PV modules with a conversion efficiency of 20%,
    75% of the area of the solar farms is covered with PV modules.
    
    
    
Energy per area: 1900 (kWh/m²/year) *0.20 * 0.75 = 285 (kWh/m²/year); = 0.285 TWh/km²/year.
total area: 4087 (TWh/year)/ 0.285 (TWh/km2/year) = 14340 km²
percentage of area: 14340 (km²) / 7663942 (km²) = 0.187 % of the total land area.

1 kWh equals 3.6 MJ therefore 2.5 kWh equals 2.5*3.6 = 9 MJ


It is hard to get a feeling of the concepts of power and energy. To understand this better, let us look at the power and energy generated by the human body. In 1994, the Spanish cyclist Miguel Indurain set a world hour record of 53040 meters in 1 hour. Spanish scientists measured an average power of 509.5 watts produced by him during that hour. What is the energy generated by him in that hour expressed in kWh?

Energy = Power * Time = 0.5095∗1=0.51 kWh.
If we consider a solar module of 250 watt-peak at Standard Test Conditions (1000W/m2), we would require 2 such modules to produce the same energy in 1 hour. 


##### Week 1: Introduction to Solar Energy > 1.2 Energy Conversion > Energy Conversion
burning fossil fuels (transforming chemical energy into thermal energy) has an efficiency of around 90%. The next step is to transform this heat into mechanical energy via e.g. a heat engine; the conversion efficiency goes up to 60%. Finally, using an electric generator with an efficiency of about 90% you can convert mechanical energy into electricity. In each step you lose some energy and combining these 3 efficiencies, you end up with 0.9*0.6*0.9=0.49 so a total conversion efficiency of 49%

The figure below shows the global electricity demand by sector up to 2009 and projections to 2035 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook report. To express the energy need of human kind we are forced to use numbers so large we cannot comprehend their meaning. To get more feeling for these numbers, we are going to calculate the average energy consumption per person.

From the figure below, what is the global per capita electricity demand in 2009 in megajoules (MJ)? Assume that the world population was 7 billion (7∗109) in 2009.
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/53e3686a95e9e916cf9f023db0a51b67/asset-v1:DelftX+ET3034x+2T2016+type@asset+block/globalelectricitydemand.png)



From the figure we see that the total global electricity demand for 2009 was around 20000 TWh. The total world population is assumed to be around 7 billion. Therefore the per capita electricity demand would be 20,000∗109(kWh)/7∗109=2857kWh.
When converting this to megajoules (MJ), remember that 1kWh=3.6MJ. Therefore the answer is 2857∗3.6=10,285MJ which is around 10,000MJ.
Note that the average electricity consumption per day per person in the world is 7.8kWh.


##### WATT-PEAK AND EFFICIENCY

Two definitions explained in the video are the watt-peak and efficiency. As an example we consider a solar module with a surface of 1.5m2 with a power output 300Wp. Watt-peak is the power generated by a module or a device under Standard Test Conditions. As will be discussed in detail at the end of this week Standard Test Conditions correspond to light irradiance of 1000Wm−2 with a spectral shape equal to AM1.5 spectrum. So under STC conditions the module would give a power of 300W. 

The efficiency is the fraction of solar energy converted into electrical energy, under STC. The efficiency of a solar cell is given by:
Efficiency=PoutPin
So the above panel has an efficiency of:  20 %.


Looking at the graph presented in the lecture that introduces the cost/efficiency relationship between the different PV technologies, it can be seen that the slope of the first generation technologies resembles that of US$ 3/Wp, while the slope of the second generation technologies is in the US$ 1/Wp range.

![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/c9daac127d2a648868658abac460efad/asset-v1:DelftX+ET3034x+2T2016+type@asset+block/Efficiency-Cost.png)

Note that current developments are progressing fast and the above figure is getting outdated. Currently, the price for the cheapest polycrystalline silicon modules is in the order of US$ 0.7/Wp.

Historical moments that range from the use of magnifying glasses or concentrating mirrors to make fire, to the contemporary achievements in solar cells.



#### Week 1: Introduction to Solar Energy > 1.5 Status and Prospects of Solar Energy > Status and Prospects of Solar Energy


The worldwide installed hydroelectricity power in 2010 was 1010GW. The worldwide total amount of electricity generated is 20200TWh per year. Assume a capacity factor for hydropower of 40%. What percentage of the total electricity generation worldwide is covered by hydropower?


The capacity factor describes the percentage of time that the power installation is running at rated capacity over a certain period of time. For example, a capacity of factor 50% means that the power plant will produce half the energy at rated capacity over a certain period. Therefore, the energy produced by the hydroelectric installations will be:
$$E= power * time * capacity factor = 1010GW*24h*0.4=9696GWh/day=9.696TWh/day$$
E=power∗time∗capacityfactor=1010GW∗24h∗0.4=9696GWh/day=9.696TWh/day
The percentage would be then:
$$\textbf{Hydro(%)}=\frac{9.696TWh*365days/year}{20200TWh/year}*100=\textbf{17.5%}$$\textbf{Hydro(%)}=\frac{9.696TWh*365days/year}{20200TWh/year}*100=\textbf{17.5%}
Hydro(%)=9.696TWh∗365days/year/(20200TWh/year)∗100=17.5%


#### Week 1: Introduction to Solar Energy > 1.6 Solar Light > Solar Light I



 photons from a monochromatic light source of a wavelength of 500nm are incident in 1 second on a surface with area of 20cm2. Calculate the photon flux (in 1021s−1m−2).

  2
 
Explanation
The photon flux is the number of photons per unit area per unit time, thus:

$$\phi=\frac{4*10^{18}}{0.002 m^2*1 s}=2*10^{21}s^{-1}m^{-2}$$

ϕ=4∗10180.002m2∗1s=2∗1021s−1m−2
Calculate the irradiance in W/m2:


794.59
 
Explanation
The irradiance can be calculated as


$$I=\phi *E_{photon}=\phi*\frac{hc}{\lambda}=2*10^{21}*\frac{6.626*10^{-34}*2.998*10^{8}}{500*10^{-9}}=794.59 W/m^2$$
I=ϕ∗Ephoton=ϕ∗hcλ=2∗1021∗6.626∗10−34∗2.998∗108500∗10−9=794.59W/m2

Solar energy

The global energy future is arguably the most important subject undertaken by the scientific community. Without energy, our society will not function. Without energy we cannot find or administer medicine to cure disease, we cannot purify water, drive our cars, operate computers, or even study at night. The current energy need is roughly 15TW15TW and with an increasing world population this number is destined to increase. Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University and Nobel laureate Richard E. Smalley coined the term the "Terawatt Challenge" based on this future energy deficit. Smalley defines the “Terawatt Challenge” as the challenge to provide the technology for accomplishing our energy goals - an alternative that can act as a basis for energy prosperity in the 21st century, that is as enabling as oil and gas have been for the past century.[1] It seems inescapable that the world of the future must embrace alternative energies.
Today most of the energy consumed in the world is provided by fossil fuels.[2] Even though the sources of fossil fuels can cover the energy consumption for many years to come, there are many good reasons to look for alternatives. Along with resource scarcity and inadequate supply CO2 pollution are strong arguments against fossil fuels.
Renewable resources including, wind, solar cells, solar thermal, geothermal, marine, and tides still represents a minor fraction of the overall primary energy supply at the present moment. With a total nameplate capacity of 93,957 MW as of the end of 2011 within Europe alone, wind is the leading alternative energy resource.[3] Several countries have high levels of penetration, such as 25.9% of electricity production in Denmark (2011), 15.6% in Spain (2011), 12% in Ireland (2011) and 10.6% in Germany (2011).[3]
In the future, it is imperative that a larger and larger share of the energy is supplied by alternative or renewable energy forms. Solar energy is an excellent choice for an environmentally friendly reliable energy source. Each day the Earth receives approx. 1.2⋅105TW1.2⋅105TW from the sun. Compared to the current energy consumption on Earth (> 20 TW) the sun sufficiently delivers energy to meet our consumption many many times. To harness the energy from the sun, we must either use solar panels which use the solar energy to heat water or we must use solar cells which produce electricity directly from sunlight. In this chapter you can read more about solar cells and the three generations of solar cells.

Solar cells

The most direct use of solar energy is the conversion of photons to electricity by the photovoltaic effect. The photovoltaic effect as a phenomenon has been documented by many early experiments with the experiment of Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel in 1839 being the most well known.[1] However, it was not until the early 1950s that the photovoltaics developed into the solar cells of today. The first solar cell was made by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson at Bell laboratories in 1954 utilizing a silicon p-n junction to achieve 6 % conversion efficiency.[2] With the space age, a market for solar cells emerged and the first American satellite Vanguard I launched in 1958 equipped with six solar cells mounted on the body. The use of solar cells on the satellite proved successful and the power-to-weight ratio of solar cells ensured their further success for space applications. For the initial history of solar cells their prices were dictated by the semiconductor industry, the price of silicon boules being the main cost factor. By 1971 the estimated price had reached $100 per watt. Since then progress have be massive. Solar cells are now part of a global industry with a multifaceted array of technologies competing. According to a study by EWEA photovoltaics accounted for the largest share of new installations within the energy sector in Europe. In 2011 21,000 MW worth of capacity was installed, accounting for 46.7% of the total installed capacity.[3]

Solar cells - the three generations

Solar cell technologies are traditionally divided into three generations. First generation solar cells are mainly based on silicon wafers and typically demonstrate a performance about 15-20 %. These types of solar cells dominate the market and are mainly those seen on rooftops. The benefits of this solar cell technology lie in their good performance, as well as their high stability. However, they are rigid and require a lot of energy in production.
The second generation solar cells are based on amorphous silicon, CIGS and CdTe, where the typical performance is 10 - 15%. Since the second generation solar cells avoid use of silicon wafers and have a lower material consumption it has been possible to reduce production costs of these types of solar cells compared to the first generation. The second generation solar cells can also be produced so they are flexible to some degree. However, as the production of second generation solar cells still include vacuum processes and high temperature treatments, there is still a large energy consumption associated with the production of these solar cells. Further, the second generation solar cells are based on scarce elements and this is a limiting factor in the price.
Third generation solar cells uses organic materials such as small molecules or polymers. Thus, polymer solar cells are a sub category of organic solar cells. The third generation also covers expensive high performance experimental multi-junction solar cells which hold the world record in solar cell performance. This type has only to some extent a commercial application because of the very high production price. A new class of thin film solar cells currently under investigation are perovskite solar cells and show huge potential with record efficiencies beyond 20% on very small area. Polymer solar cells or plastic solar cells, on the other hand, offer several advantages such as a simple, quick and inexpensive large-scale production and use of materials that are readily available and potentially inexpensive. Polymer solar cells can be fabricated with well-known industrial roll-to-roll (R2R) technologies that can be compared to the printing of newspapers. Although the performance and stability of third generation solar cells is still limited compared to first and second generation solar cells, they have great potential and are already commercialized, e.g. by infinityPV.com. Research interest in polymer solar cells has increased significantly in recent years and it is now possible to produce them at a price that enables projects such as the freeOPV initiative.[1]

​其实目前整个能经学界，包括运筹和控制相关领域，在微观和产业层面都在着眼的研究问题是：分布式和储能补贴的市场设计和补贴设计问题。


分布式和储能补贴的确已经迫在眉睫了，但其设计尤为困难。


欧美分布式补贴的设计粗糙已经造成了劫贫济富的电价分摊模式和无效投资已经被广泛诟病。但最糟糕的，是目前欧美这种“政府代替市场机制定价”的计划经济补贴模式造成了分布式相关企业甚至整个产业的高债务风险和政策脆弱。太阳城等企业存亡高度依赖于现行“政府代替市场机制定价”的计划经济补贴模式的存废。可以说艾伦马斯克的所有能源项目能不能投资（不是值不值得，而是能不能），高度依赖于川普给他什么样的扶持和补贴。


分布式补贴的设计难题，在于怎么样设计一个“非线性/歧视性”补贴机制以及基础的分布式市场应该怎么设计和建立的问题。其中的根本问题是分布式对配网的物理影响的经济问题没有搞清。在此基础上，什么是正确的给分布式的价格，和如何传递这种价格信号，研究还很初步。


储能的问题更严重，但归根结底也一样，就是储能提供了什么服务、多少种服务、这些服务怎么定价？是分别定价，还是单一定价？


这些问题不有一个初步但系统性的厘清，补贴下去对市场运营、系统减排和技术进步的后果很难说。但是系统稳定、环保要求和商业的现实，也使得这些补贴已经是不得不发了。


那么在这样的背景下，我认为还是应该把补贴放到研发侧，而不通过装机补贴等给市场的供给和需求侧。这样的补贴相对来说，在目前相关认知还很欠缺、全世界配网侧市场还极为原始的现状下，可能是比较稳妥的。
