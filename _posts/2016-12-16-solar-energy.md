Solar generated more electricity than coal in the UK for the first month on record in May.

Solar generated around 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricy in May, 50 per cent more than the 893GWh generated by coal, according to analysis by Carbon Brief.

Carbon brief had previously said that solar power beat two "largely symbolic" milestones in May when it beat coal for the first full day on April 9 and for the first week on May 3.

The day coal power dropped out of the national grid
The increase in solar-powered electricity comes as the amount of coal in the national grid fell to zero several times in May, thought to be the first time this had happened for more than 100 years.

Solar made up 6 per cent of the UK's electricity in May, while coal made up only 4 per cent. In January solar made up 1 per cent and coal 17 per cent.
