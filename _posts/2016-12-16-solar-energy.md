A transformation is happening in global energy markets that’s worth noting as 2016 comes to an end: solar power, for the first time, is becoming the cheapest form of new electricity.

This has happened in isolated projects in the past. An especially competitive auction in the Middle East, for example, resulted in record-cheap solar costs. But now unsubsidised solar is beginning to outcompete coal and natural gas on a larger scale, and notably, new solar projects in emerging markets are costing less to build than wind projects, according to fresh data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.






#### Solar vs Coal

Solar generated more electricity than coal in the UK for the first month on record in May.

Solar generated around 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricy in May, 50 per cent more than the 893GWh generated by coal, according to analysis by Carbon Brief.

Carbon brief had previously said that solar power beat two "largely symbolic" milestones in May when it beat coal for the first full day on April 9 and for the first week on May 3.



The day coal power dropped out of the national grid
The increase in solar-powered electricity comes as the amount of coal in the national grid fell to zero several times in May, thought to be the first time this had happened for more than 100 years.

Solar made up 6 per cent of the UK's electricity in May, while coal made up only 4 per cent. In January solar made up 1 per cent and coal 17 per cent.

#### Cost
1/26 Solar power becoming world's cheapest form of electricity production - Thursday December 15

Solar power is becoming the cheapest way to generate electricity, according to leading analysts.
 
 Data produced by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) showed the cost of solar in 58 lower-income countries – including China, Brazil and India – had fallen to about a third of levels in 2010 and was now slightly cheaper than wind energy.

Solar energy has by far the biggest energy potential and also is the fastest growing source of energy. Some of the questions we will answer with this video are: How much electricity can photovoltaic (PV) cells, solar thermal and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) towers produce? What is the power density of solar energy and what are the pros and cons.


### Solar energy in the USA.

Solar Energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the USA. In some states it has become competitive with other energy sources. In this excercise we will find out what the  potential for solar power is. The image below illustrates the average annual irradiation in the USA. You can immediately see the advantage the USA has over Germany in terms of solar energy yield.

Facts about the USA in 2016:

Mainland land area: 7,663,942 km²
Population: 319 million
Electricity consumption: 4087 TWh/year
