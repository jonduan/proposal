## A New Post

The dramatically lower price of utility-scale solar power and wind power compared to fossil fuels and nuclear power should be evident to everyone today. 

these are levelized cost of energy (LCOE) estimates from Lazard based on various assumptions, and they are averages for the US as a whole rather than prices for specific locations within the US, but the lower estimated costs for these renewables are reflected in the real world as well, where solar & wind accounted for 69% of new capacity additions in 2015, 99% of new capacity additions in Q1 2016, a large portion of new capacity additions in Q2 2016, and probably ~â…” of new capacity additions for 2016 as a whole.

The low costs of solar power and wind power crush coal power, crush nuclear power, and beat natural gas by a sizable margin

## Solar & Wind Became Much Cheaper In The Past 7 Years (85% and 66%, Respectively)
