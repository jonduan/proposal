## A New Post

Definition

• Energy = capacity to do work

• Kinds of work:

  – Mechanical work = displacement of mass

      displacement of mass = force x distance

      force x distance = (mass x acceleration) x distance

      e.g. (kg x m/s2) x m = Newton x meter = joule

  – Thermal work = displacement of atoms


      atoms become agitated (i.e. move) when heat is applied
      e.g. 1 calorie = energy req’d to increase temp of 1 gram of water by 1ºC
      1 calorie = 4.19 joules <=> 1 joule = approx 0.25 calories


  – Electrical work = displacement of electrons

      electrons may be induced by a magnetic field to travel through a circuit
      e.g. 1 joule can induce 1 amp through 1 ohm of resistance for 1 second
      
      
### Units of Energy

• joule

• (mechanical)

  – foot-pound
  – horsepower-hour
  
• (thermal)

  – British Thermal Unit (BTU)
  – therm
  – calorie
  
• (electrical)

  – kilowatt-hour
      
      
### The evolving demand for energy

• Innovation changes the nature of energy demand

• Pre-history: food calories + body => manual labor

• Traditional (e.g.): flowing water + wheel => milling

• Modern (e.g.): combustion + turbine => electricity

#### Energy eras:


| era (defining technology)  | distinctive work requirements  | primary energy sources  |
|---|---|---|
| pre-industrial (agriculture): ≤ mid 1700’s  | mechanical for field work,<br>
agricultural goods processing,<br>
transport to market; thermal for<br>
heating, lighting   |  food calories for manual & animal labor, some<br>
renewables (e.g. hydro, wind) for milling,<br>
transportation; wood for home heating, passive<br>
solar for lighting, food calories for lamp oils |

### Determinants of Demand
• What drives demand for primary energy resources?

A: price of related goods (complements and substitutes)
  - via technical change?
  - via urbanization?

A: total income
  - via productivity (Δ earnings per person)
  - via population (Δ # people)
  - via government policy (income taxes and subsidies)

####  Global demand for energy

71-11, global energy demand doubled .  Most from electricity in emerging economies.

• Modest growth, diversification in developed nations

  – total OECD demand up 0.7% annually
  – decline in coal, flat oil, growth in electricity, natural gas,
  and renewables
  
• Global growth led by emerging economies

  – demand up for all types of energy
  – rapid growth since early 2000’s
  – equivalent to 61% of OECD demand in 1973
  – up to 134% of OECD demand in 2011
 
 
 Since 1971, the greatest growth in energy demand has come from China and the rest of Asia.
 
 For OECD nations, the biggest drop in final consumption since 1971 has occurred in consumption of coal
 
### summary
 
 
 Energy is the capacity to do ...

  Mechanical Work

  Thermal Work

  Electrical Work

Innovation allows us to ...

  Do more work with the same amount of energy

  Do the same amount of work with less energy

  Find new ways to harness and use energy


Energy density is an important consideration for energy business because ...

A higher density fuel will produce the same amount of energy using relatively less fuel


## week 2: Supply of Energy

Primary energy supplies:

• what primary energy sources do we use?

• how do we utilize these primary sources to satisfy our demand for energy?

• where are primary energy sources located?

• why are primary energy resources developed?

• supply/demand equilibrium for energy

• economic imperfections and politics in energy markets



#### What Primary Resources Can We Utilize?


[Few transportation fuels surpass the energy densities of gasoline and diesel](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9991)

![](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2013.02.14/density.png)

The chart above compares energy densities (both per unit volume and per unit weight) for several transportation fuels that are available throughout the United States. The data points represent the energy content per unit volume or weight of the fuels themselves, not including the storage tanks or other equipment that the fuels require. For instance, compressed fuels require heavy storage tanks, while cooled fuels require equipment to maintain low temperatures.


Beyond gasoline and diesel, other fuels like compressed propane, ethanol, and methanol offer energy densities per unit volume that are less than gasoline and diesel, and energy densities per unit weight that are less than or equal to that of gasoline. Natural gas, either in liquefied form (LNG) or compressed (CNG), are lighter than gasoline but again have lower densities per unit volume. The same is true for hydrogen fuels, which must be either cooled (down to -253oC) or compressed (to 3,000 to 10,000 psi).

#### Cost of energy from primary sources

Projected LCOE in the U.S. by 2020 (as of 2015)

It 	 : 	investment expenditures in the year t
Mt 	 : 	operations and maintenance expenditures in the year t
Ft 	 : 	fuel expenditures in the year t
Et 	 : 	electrical energy generated in the year t
r 	 : 	discount rate
n 	 : 	expected lifetime of system or power station




The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is a measure of a power source which attempts to compare different methods of electricity generation on a comparable basis. It is an economic assessment of the average total cost to build and operate a power-generating asset over its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that lifetime. The LCOE can also be regarded as the minimum cost at which electricity must be sold in order to break-even over the lifetime of the project.

[Statistical Review of World Energy](http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html)

The 65th edition of the BP Statistical Review of World Energy sets out energy data for 2015, revealing a year in which significant long-term trends in both the global demand and supply of energy came to the fore with global energy consumption slowing further and the mix of energy sources shifting towards lower-carbon fuels.

  - supply increasing due to Sa;s

 - Demand of energy in China

 - Supply from Shale gas, push down of oil price.

##### Renewables potential

• Not ‘reserves’

• renewables energy supplies are those taken from
natural flows occurring around us:

  – sun
  – wind
  – flowing water

• renewables potential ≈ non-renewables reserves
