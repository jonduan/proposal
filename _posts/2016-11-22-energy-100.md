## A New Post

Definition

• Energy = capacity to do work

• Kinds of work:

  – Mechanical work = displacement of mass

      displacement of mass = force x distance

      force x distance = (mass x acceleration) x distance

      e.g. (kg x m/s2) x m = Newton x meter = joule

  – Thermal work = displacement of atoms


      atoms become agitated (i.e. move) when heat is applied
      e.g. 1 calorie = energy req’d to increase temp of 1 gram of water by 1ºC
      1 calorie = 4.19 joules <=> 1 joule = approx 0.25 calories


  – Electrical work = displacement of electrons

      electrons may be induced by a magnetic field to travel through a circuit
      e.g. 1 joule can induce 1 amp through 1 ohm of resistance for 1 second
      
      
### Units of Energy

• joule

• (mechanical)

  – foot-pound
  – horsepower-hour
  
• (thermal)

  – British Thermal Unit (BTU)
  – therm
  – calorie
  
• (electrical)

  – kilowatt-hour
      
      
### The evolving demand for energy

• Innovation changes the nature of energy demand

• Pre-history: food calories + body => manual labor

• Traditional (e.g.): flowing water + wheel => milling

• Modern (e.g.): combustion + turbine => electricity

#### Energy eras:


| era (defining technology)  | distinctive work requirements  | primary energy sources  |
|---|---|---|
| pre-industrial (agriculture): ≤ mid 1700’s  | mechanical for field work,<br>
agricultural goods processing,<br>
transport to market; thermal for<br>
heating, lighting   |  food calories for manual & animal labor, some<br>
renewables (e.g. hydro, wind) for milling,<br>
transportation; wood for home heating, passive<br>
solar for lighting, food calories for lamp oils |

### Determinants of Demand
• What drives demand for primary energy resources?

A: price of related goods (complements and substitutes)
  - via technical change?
  - via urbanization?

A: total income
  - via productivity (Δ earnings per person)
  - via population (Δ # people)
  - via government policy (income taxes and subsidies)

####  Global demand for energy

71-11, demand double.  Most from electricity in emerging economies.

• Modest growth, diversification in developed nations

  – total OECD demand up 0.7% annually
  – decline in coal, flat oil, growth in electricity, natural gas,
  and renewables
  
• Global growth led by emerging economies

  – demand up for all types of energy
  – rapid growth since early 2000’s
  – equivalent to 61% of OECD demand in 1973
  – up to 134% of OECD demand in 2011
