What is an energy system and what is final and primary energy use? What are the functions of our energy system? How does our energy system perform in terms of efficiency?



1. Final energy use



2. Primary energy use

Heating the water and the eggs costs 200 kJ of useful energy. The natural gas-fired cooker has an efficiency of 40%. In the natural-gas production chain, the energy losses associated to the winning and transport equal 5%.

Final energy demand = useful energy input / energy efficiency = 200 kJ / 40 % = 500 kJ


Primary energy demand = Final energy demand /chain efficiency = 500 kJ / 95% = 526 kJ (rounded)
Chain efficiency natural gas production = 100% - 5% (energy losses for winning and transport) = 95%


The electric cooker on the other hand has an efficiency of 80%. In the electricity production chain, the overall losses occurring are assumed to be 64%.


The useful energy, energy that goes into the eggs, is even lower than the useful energy from the previous parts of this assignment. Assume that you boil 2 eggs (50 g each) in 0.4 liter water, and that the specific heat capacity of eggs is the same as that of water.


What is the full chain efficiency, in %, from primary energy to useful energy ending up in the eggs when using the electric cooker?

#### Energy Analysis > 3.2 Constructing the energy balance of a country 



###### energy balances.

What are the energy flows of a household and how can we translate these to an energy balance? This will be the basis for the next step: energy balances of countries. Which elements do these balances consist of?



####### Setting up the energy balance


𝑇𝑃𝐸𝑆= 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔+𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠−𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠


####### The Energy Conversion sector

𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦= 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡/
𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 


####### The Energy Use Sectors

𝑇𝐹𝐶=𝑇𝑃𝐸𝑆 −𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡+𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡


In the table below you find the incomplete energy balance for the country Coronie.
