What is an energy system and what is final and primary energy use? What are the functions of our energy system? How does our energy system perform in terms of efficiency?



1. Final energy use



2. Primary energy use

Heating the water and the eggs costs 200 kJ of useful energy. The natural gas-fired cooker has an efficiency of 40%. In the natural-gas production chain, the energy losses associated to the winning and transport equal 5%.

Final energy demand = useful energy input / energy efficiency = 200 kJ / 40 % = 500 kJ


Primary energy demand = Final energy demand /chain efficiency = 500 kJ / 95% = 526 kJ (rounded)
Chain efficiency natural gas production = 100% - 5% (energy losses for winning and transport) = 95%
