Heating the water and the eggs costs 200 kJ of useful energy. The natural gas-fired cooker has an efficiency of 40%. In the natural-gas production chain, the energy losses associated to the winning and transport equal 5%.

Final energy demand = useful energy input / energy efficiency = 200 kJ / 40 % = 500 kJ


Primary energy demand = Final energy demand /chain efficiency = 500 kJ / 95% = 526 kJ (rounded)
Chain efficiency natural gas production = 100% - 5% (energy losses for winning and transport) = 95%


The electric cooker on the other hand has an efficiency of 80%. In the electricity production chain, the overall losses occurring are assumed to be 64%.


The useful energy, energy that goes into the eggs, is even lower than the useful energy from the previous parts of this assignment. Assume that you boil 2 eggs (50 g each) in 0.4 liter water, and that the specific heat capacity of eggs is the same as that of water.


What is the full chain efficiency, in %, from primary energy to useful energy ending up in the eggs when using the electric cooker?

#### Energy Analysis > 3.2 Constructing the energy balance of a country 



###### energy balances.

What are the energy flows of a household and how can we translate these to an energy balance? This will be the basis for the next step: energy balances of countries. Which elements do these balances consist of?

The Government of Coronie wants to have a good understanding of the energy system and wants a completed energy balance for policy purposes. As an energy analyst, your task is to complete this energy balance for the Government.  

What you know about Coronie, is that all coal is imported and all gas is produced in Coronie. No electricity is imported or exported, as there are no interconnectors with the neighbouring countries. Furthermore, in 2015 there was no electricity generation from renewable sources like wind, solar, bio or hydro. 


You get this answer by first subtracting the TPES of electricity from the TFC of electricity.
Subsequently, you subtract from the previously found value, the value in the electricity column and the other conversions row.
In this case:
1) 730 - 0 = 730
2) 730 - (-70) = 800


In Coronie, 50% of the electricity is generated in coal fired power plants with an efficiency of 40%. The rest of the electricity is generated in gas fired power plants with an efficiency of 50%.

How much coal and gas is used for the electricity production? Which answer indicates te values to be filled in the "electricity plants" row?

coal required = -( (0.5 x 800) / 0.4 ) = -1000
gas required = -( (0.5 x 800) / 0.5 ) = -800

TPES = TFC - conversions
TPES coal = 130 - (-100 + -1000) = 1230
TPES gas = 672 - (-200 + -800) = 1672
TPES electricity = 730 - (-70 + 800) = 0
TPES total = TPES coal + TPES gas + TPES electricity = 2902



#### actual energy balances in a simplified form.

How do we read and compare these balances? And what can we learn from them?


###### How to read the energy balance of a country?

In the following exercises you have to calculate the conversion efficiency of the power plants for several fuels and for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

calculate the conversion efficiency of the power plants for several fuels and for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

Calculate (for Europe EU28) the conversion efficiency of public electricity plants by fuel. (You can find the numbers at the bottom of the table)


1 TWh = 3.6 PJ


What is the generation efficiency for the coal plants? 




What is the efficiency for the petroleum-based electricity plants?

fuel input (oil + oil products) = 487 PJ
electricity output (oil + oil products) = 173 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
efficiency = (173/487) x 100% = 36%

What is the efficiency for the gas fired electricity plants?

fuel input = 1949PJ
electricity output = 1003 PJ
efficiency = (1003/1949) x 100% = 52%

What is the efficiency for the biofuel electricity plants? 

fuel input = 770 PJ
electricity output = 232 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
efficiency = (232/770) x 100% = 30%

Calculate (for Europe EU28) the general conversion efficiency of the public electricity plants.

total fuel input = 21694 PJ
electricity output = 9269 PJ
efficiency = (9269/21694) x 100% = 43%




Calculate (for Europe EU28) the conversion efficiency of public Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

Total fuel input (from row ‘CHP Plants’):
2671 + 6 + 402 + 2536 + 127 + 1240 = 6982 PJ
Electricity output: 2484 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
Electricity generation efficiency = (2484 PJ /6982 PJ) x 100% = 36%
Heat output: 1761 PJ
Heat generation efficiency = (1761 PJ /6982 PJ) x 100% = 25%
Total efficiency: 36% + 25% = 61%

#### Energy Analysis > 3.4 Factors determining our energy us

Our energy demand and subsequently our energy use is dependent on a multitude of factors.

In this lecture we will look at the three main factors which are determining our energy use. What are these factors? How do they determine our energy use?

• Helps to stabilize or reduce energy use


What are the main drivers behind our Global energy use?

Volume - Structure - Efficiency

The energy demand and the Economic growth measured by for instance the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), especially for Industrialized countries, are  decoupled

In many Industrialized countries the energy demand has been decreasing, mainly due to improving energy efficiency


##### Energy efficiency can be considered as the main driver to limit our future energy use. 

But how can energy efficiency contribute in limiting our future energy use? We will take a look at possible applications of measures to improve energy efficiency in the various sectors. We will explore measures for homes, office buildings, cars, and industry.

The steel industry has been one of the largest contributors to the energy use in the country for decades. For the steel industry in particular the energy use is expected to increase, together with the increase in the steal production. But to guarantee the security of the energy suply in Surimaribo, the steel industry must improve their energy efficiency in order to minimize the increase in their energy use.

As an engineer you are asked what measures the steel industry can implement to further improve their efficiency, while maintaining a profitable business.

Choose three efficiency improvement measures for the steel industry, with the highest likelihood of having a big impact?

 - heat integration

 - more efficient equipment e.g. furnaces, pumps etc.

 - heat recovery


SEC = Energy Use/Steel production SEC 2015 = 240 TJ/12 Mt = 20 TJ/Mt

A newly proposed energy efficiency improvement package by the government of Surimaribo is expected to lead to an annual efficiency improvement of 2% from 2015 to 2020.

If this policy package is actually implemented, how high (TJ) will the energy use by the steel industry be in 2020?

(1-0.02)^5 x (20 TJ/Mt) x 15 Mt = 271.18 TJ


#### Energy Analysis > 3.6 Trends and scenarios in the global energy use

Until now you have encountered various energy carriers in this course, both fossil-based like coal and oil, but also renewable energy carriers such as wind and biomass.

This subsection contains two lectures. In the first lecture you will get a concise introduction to the global trends, both historic and expected, for these energy carriers. The next lecture is about the use of scenarios.

2014: 81% of our energy supply is fossil based (IEA, 2016)


2004  - 2014 wind grew by 23% per year

2004  - 2014 solar grew by 52% per year


#### Week 3: Energy Analysis > 3.6 Trends and scenarios in the global energy use

Scenarios: possible pathways of how these trends may develop in the future.

Why should we use energy scenarios and what do they tell us about our future energy demand and supply?

Is a 100% renewable energy supply plausible by 2050?




###### Trends in the Global energy use

The energy use coming from the commercial or service sector is strongly rising . This is especially the case for the developed countries

Globally oil is the most important energy carrier. But due to the relatively high price, in comparison with coal and natural gas, the expected trend is that the use of oil will mainly focus on the transport sector and the petrochemical industry



China has a major share in the Global coal use.

However, the demand is expected to decrease as the economic growth in China is expected to decrease


Currently our renewable energy supply is largely dominated by traditional biomass like wood for cooking. However the utilization of many new renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, is on the rise .

In the period 2004-2014, the generation of wind energy grew by 20 - 40% per year, in relative terms.


In the period 2004-2014, the generation of solar photovoltaic energy grew by more than 40% per year, in relative terms.


##### Energy scenarios for the world

As energy analyst you are hired by the United Nations to provide the World leaders with advice on how they should shape energy policy for the future, a future of renewable energy. In your first meeting with the Heads of State your plan is to convince them that energy scenarios are very important for you to do bring out a well grounded advice.


various purposes for which scenarios can be useful. 
Assess the impact of policy measures.
Get insight on plausible futures.
Estimate market opportunities.

Attain an optimum investment planning.



The question arises what factors, determining our energy supply and demand, are then so uncertain. 

technological development in renewable energy and energy use technology
market developments

energy related policy
potential of unconventional fossil energy sources



At the start of this task you decide to conduct a review of the existing scenario studies for our future energy demand and supply. You encounter a huge amount of scenarios from different organizations and for different purposes. In this field of energy scenarios, which is the most referred to set of scenarios?
