What is an energy system and what is final and primary energy use? What are the functions of our energy system? How does our energy system perform in terms of efficiency?

Heating the water and the eggs costs 200 kJ of useful energy. The natural gas-fired cooker has an efficiency of 40%. In the natural-gas production chain, the energy losses associated to the winning and transport equal 5%.

Final energy demand = useful energy input / energy efficiency = 200 kJ / 40 % = 500 kJ


Primary energy demand = Final energy demand /chain efficiency = 500 kJ / 95% = 526 kJ (rounded)
Chain efficiency natural gas production = 100% - 5% (energy losses for winning and transport) = 95%


The electric cooker on the other hand has an efficiency of 80%. In the electricity production chain, the overall losses occurring are assumed to be 64%.


The useful energy, energy that goes into the eggs, is even lower than the useful energy from the previous parts of this assignment. Assume that you boil 2 eggs (50 g each) in 0.4 liter water, and that the specific heat capacity of eggs is the same as that of water.


What is the full chain efficiency, in %, from primary energy to useful energy ending up in the eggs when using the electric cooker?

###### energy balances.

What are the energy flows of a household and how can we translate these to an energy balance? This will be the basis for the next step: energy balances of countries. Which elements do these balances consist of?

The Government of Coronie wants to have a good understanding of the energy system and wants a completed energy balance for policy purposes. As an energy analyst, your task is to complete this energy balance for the Government.  

What you know about Coronie, is that all coal is imported and all gas is produced in Coronie. No electricity is imported or exported, as there are no interconnectors with the neighbouring countries. Furthermore, in 2015 there was no electricity generation from renewable sources like wind, solar, bio or hydro. 


You get this answer by first subtracting the TPES of electricity from the TFC of electricity.
Subsequently, you subtract from the previously found value, the value in the electricity column and the other conversions row.
In this case:
1) 730 - 0 = 730
2) 730 - (-70) = 800


In Coronie, 50% of the electricity is generated in coal fired power plants with an efficiency of 40%. The rest of the electricity is generated in gas fired power plants with an efficiency of 50%.

How much coal and gas is used for the electricity production? Which answer indicates te values to be filled in the "electricity plants" row?

coal required = -( (0.5 x 800) / 0.4 ) = -1000
gas required = -( (0.5 x 800) / 0.5 ) = -800

TPES = TFC - conversions
TPES coal = 130 - (-100 + -1000) = 1230
TPES gas = 672 - (-200 + -800) = 1672
TPES electricity = 730 - (-70 + 800) = 0
TPES total = TPES coal + TPES gas + TPES electricity = 2902



#### actual energy balances in a simplified form.

How do we read and compare these balances? And what can we learn from them?


###### How to read the energy balance of a country?

#### Efficiency of the conversion sector

calculate the efficiency of the conversion sector for the 28 EU memberstates, using 2012 data. You are provided with the cumulative energy balance for the 28 EU memberstates in 2012. 

The energy balance, provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), can be found by clicking on the link below: 

[energy_balance_of_EU28.pdf](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/51b91b369bf1c9d968c82e98ae091fdb/asset-v1:DelftX+EnergyX+2T2016+type@asset+block/energy_balance_of_EU28.pdf)


The energy conversion efficiency of an activity can be calculated as the total energy output, divided by the total energy input.

In the following exercises you have to calculate the conversion efficiency of the power plants for several fuels and for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

calculate the conversion efficiency of the power plants for several fuels and for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

Calculate (for Europe EU28) the conversion efficiency of public electricity plants by fuel. (You can find the numbers at the bottom of the table)


1 TWh = 3.6 PJ


What is the generation efficiency for the coal plants? 




What is the efficiency for the petroleum-based electricity plants?

fuel input (oil + oil products) = 487 PJ
electricity output (oil + oil products) = 173 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
efficiency = (173/487) x 100% = 36%

What is the efficiency for the gas fired electricity plants?

fuel input = 1949PJ
electricity output = 1003 PJ
efficiency = (1003/1949) x 100% = 52%

What is the efficiency for the biofuel electricity plants? 

fuel input = 770 PJ
electricity output = 232 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
efficiency = (232/770) x 100% = 30%

Calculate (for Europe EU28) the general conversion efficiency of the public electricity plants.

total fuel input = 21694 PJ
electricity output = 9269 PJ
efficiency = (9269/21694) x 100% = 43%




Calculate (for Europe EU28) the conversion efficiency of public Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.

Total fuel input (from row ‘CHP Plants’):
2671 + 6 + 402 + 2536 + 127 + 1240 = 6982 PJ
Electricity output: 2484 PJ 1 TWh = 3.6 PJ
Electricity generation efficiency = (2484 PJ /6982 PJ) x 100% = 36%
Heat output: 1761 PJ
Heat generation efficiency = (1761 PJ /6982 PJ) x 100% = 25%
Total efficiency: 36% + 25% = 61%

#### Energy Analysis > 3.4 Factors determining our energy us

Our energy demand and subsequently our energy use is dependent on a multitude of factors.

In this lecture we will look at the three main factors which are determining our energy use. What are these factors? How do they determine our energy use?

Industry
Household
Food

Decoupling of the GDP and energy use II: efficiency

the amount of energy required per unit of ac3vity of the various structure types 
• Doing more with less 
• Helps to stabilize or reduce energy use


What are the main drivers behind our Global energy use?

Volume - Structure - Efficiency

The energy demand and the Economic growth measured by for instance the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), especially for Industrialized countries, are  decoupled

In many Industrialized countries the energy demand has been decreasing, mainly due to improving energy efficiency


##### Energy efficiency can be considered as the main driver to limit our future energy use. 

But how can energy efficiency contribute in limiting our future energy use? We will take a look at possible applications of measures to improve energy efficiency in the various sectors. We will explore measures for homes, office buildings, cars, and industry.
