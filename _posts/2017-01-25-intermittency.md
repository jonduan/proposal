    The grid operator plans the operation of the grid over three different time scales. The amount of electricity supply available is scheduled one day ahead, and then balanced with demand on an hour-by-hour and second-by-second basis. (Source: DOE/EERE)

    This figure from the California grid operator shows the anticipated effect of increasing solar generation on the state’s net load (load minus renewables) in the future. The amount of other electricity resources required in the middle of the day is reduced significantly, and fast-ramping generators are required to compensate for solar between 4 and 8 p.m. (Source: CAISO)
  
## The Law of Large Numbers
  
it turns out that renewable energy actually becomes more predictable as the number of renewable generators connected to the grid increases thanks to the effect of geographic diversity and the Law of Large Numbers.

    Data collected through the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program reveal how aggregating solar resources across a utility territory significantly reduces second-to-second variations in power output, even when only 20 locations are combined. (Source: Perez et al., 2009) 
    
Because the grid operator is only concerned with balancing the total amount of renewable generation with the rest of the grid, the Law of Large Numbers causes the amount of reserve capacity required to balance renewables with the grid on a second-by-second basis to be a lot less than intuition suggests. In a study commissioned by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, General Electric calculated how much new reserve capacity will be required as Texas increases the amount of wind energy installed. The report found that an additional 15,000 megawatts of installed wind energy only requires an additional 18 megawatts of new flexible reserve capacity to maintain the stability of the grid. In other words, the spare capacity of one fast-ramping natural gas power plant can compensate for the variability introduced by 5,000 new average-sized wind turbines.
    
Fortunately, experience has shown that it is possible to effectively model and predict the aggregate renewable power available to the grid. Both wind and solar depend on natural systems that can be modeled and forecasted with reasonable accuracy. Today, wind energy makes up over 10 percent of Texas’s annual electricity supply, thanks in part to effective wind generation forecasts. This is especially significant because Texas has a unique isolated grid, with no way to access extra conventional electricity generation from outside the state.

Forecasted and Actual Wind Power Production  Print Version
This Dashboard provides a graphical view of the wind power production for the current day and the Day-Ahead by COP HSL, Short Term Wind Power Forecast (STWPF) and Wind Generation Resource Power Potential (WGRPP.) The graph updates hourly with the most recent COP HSL and Day-Ahead 1430 COP HSL; the Actual Hourly Average is graphed up to the current hour ending. The Actual Wind Power Production value in the upper right corner is updated every 5 minutes along with the update timestamp.
Current Day provides 24 hours of the most recent COP HSL/STWPF/WGRPP and Day-Ahead 1430 COP HSL/STWPF/WGRPP and up to the previous hour ending for the actual hourly average.
Next Day provides 24 hours of most recent COP HSL/STWPF/WGRPP and Day-Ahead 1430 COP HSL/STWPF/WGRPP.

The FACT is that demand is intermittent, making the whole grid (with or without renewable energy) intermittent.
One must forecast demand, similar to forecasting wind & sun, and the traditional way of supplying power has been to dispatch different types of generators: baseload generators like coal & nuclear cannot be ramped up & down to meet load, so they run nearly full capacity around the clock; load-following generators can be scheduled to meet expected demand; peaking generators (like gas turbines & hydropower dams) can be adjusted to meet rapid demand changes.

Different kinds of power generation & demand are variables with distinctly different dispatch characteristics (even demand management can be viewed as dispatchable demand). Balancing sources & sinks of electricity requires finding a mix of generators (and increasingly, demand management strategies) which succeeds with high probability. The claim that intermittent power sources like wind & solar are uniquely incompatible with the existing grid ignores the fact that variability that is already part of grid management.

Consequently, adding intermittent renewables like wind & solar is not as big of a leap as some claim: existing peaking & load-following generators can handle modest amounts (with upgrades in forecasting & scheduling). (20% wind is a figure that's been around for decades, more recently 30%)
