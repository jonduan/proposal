    The grid operator plans the operation of the grid over three different time scales. The amount of electricity supply available is scheduled one day ahead, and then balanced with demand on an hour-by-hour and second-by-second basis. (Source: DOE/EERE)

    This figure from the California grid operator shows the anticipated effect of increasing solar generation on the stateâ€™s net load (load minus renewables) in the future. The amount of other electricity resources required in the middle of the day is reduced significantly, and fast-ramping generators are required to compensate for solar between 4 and 8 p.m. (Source: CAISO)
  
## The Law of Large Numbers
  
    it turns out that renewable energy actually becomes more predictable as the number of renewable generators connected to the grid increases thanks to the effect of geographic diversity and the Law of Large Numbers.
