    The grid operator plans the operation of the grid over three different time scales. The amount of electricity supply available is scheduled one day ahead, and then balanced with demand on an hour-by-hour and second-by-second basis. (Source: DOE/EERE)

    This figure from the California grid operator shows the anticipated effect of increasing solar generation on the state’s net load (load minus renewables) in the future. The amount of other electricity resources required in the middle of the day is reduced significantly, and fast-ramping generators are required to compensate for solar between 4 and 8 p.m. (Source: CAISO)
  
## The Law of Large Numbers
  
it turns out that renewable energy actually becomes more predictable as the number of renewable generators connected to the grid increases thanks to the effect of geographic diversity and the Law of Large Numbers.

    Data collected through the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program reveal how aggregating solar resources across a utility territory significantly reduces second-to-second variations in power output, even when only 20 locations are combined. (Source: Perez et al., 2009) 
    
Because the grid operator is only concerned with balancing the total amount of renewable generation with the rest of the grid, the Law of Large Numbers causes the amount of reserve capacity required to balance renewables with the grid on a second-by-second basis to be a lot less than intuition suggests. In a study commissioned by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, General Electric calculated how much new reserve capacity will be required as Texas increases the amount of wind energy installed. The report found that an additional 15,000 megawatts of installed wind energy only requires an additional 18 megawatts of new flexible reserve capacity to maintain the stability of the grid. In other words, the spare capacity of one fast-ramping natural gas power plant can compensate for the variability introduced by 5,000 new average-sized wind turbines.
    
Fortunately, experience has shown that it is possible to effectively model and predict the aggregate renewable power available to the grid. Both wind and solar depend on natural systems that can be modeled and forecasted with reasonable accuracy. Today, wind energy makes up over 10 percent of Texas’s annual electricity supply, thanks in part to effective wind generation forecasts. This is especially significant because Texas has a unique isolated grid, with no way to access extra conventional electricity generation from outside the state.

The FACT is that demand is intermittent, making the whole grid (with or without renewable energy) intermittent.
One must forecast demand, similar to forecasting wind & sun, and the traditional way of supplying power has been to dispatch different types of generators: baseload generators like coal & nuclear cannot be ramped up & down to meet load, so they run nearly full capacity around the clock; load-following generators can be scheduled to meet expected demand; peaking generators (like gas turbines & hydropower dams) can be adjusted to meet rapid demand changes.

Different kinds of power generation & demand are variables with distinctly different dispatch characteristics (even demand management can be viewed as dispatchable demand). Balancing sources & sinks of electricity requires finding a mix of generators (and increasingly, demand management strategies) which succeeds with high probability. The claim that intermittent power sources like wind & solar are uniquely incompatible with the existing grid ignores the fact that variability that is already part of grid management.

Consequently, adding intermittent renewables like wind & solar is not as big of a leap as some claim: existing peaking & load-following generators can handle modest amounts (with upgrades in forecasting & scheduling). (20% wind is a figure that's been around for decades, more recently 30%)




----------------

BY 2020 the TESLA GIGAFACTORY in NEVADA will be 100% complete it will the single largest industrial manufacturing plant in the world and it will be 100% powered 24/7 by Solar, Wind, Geothermal and battery storage and buffering.

LCOE does not capture the cost of backing up renewables when they aren't producing, or reflect their net cost - which increases at higher penetration levels. In Texas/ERCOT today, wind without subsidies does not pencil out because it crushes market prices during the very hours that wind produces at its highest levels. The same is true for solar in California.

A wind/solar PPA at $40/MWh or even $20/MWh sounds good, but not if you could have instead purchased power during those hours for $10/MWh or even seen negative prices and are forced to pay the wholesale market to take your surplus power (or curtail output). On Christmas day it looks like about 4000 MW of wind power was economically curtailed in ERCOT during the early morning hours when energy market prices fell to < $1/MWh.

------
Nuclear is about 90%. Coal has an availability of about 85% but we use is less.

Thing is, there is no way to predict when a thermal plant will suddenly go offline. That means that we need spinning reserve at all times to cover those plants. With wind and solar we know how much output will be available and when at least a day in advance. There's no need for spinning reserve with wind and solar.

Wind and solar will bankrupt and are bankrupting thermal generators. We've now closed both nuclear and coal plants because they can't compete with wind and solar. That's how business works, you make a profit until someone comes along and takes your market away. At that point you go out of business.

"then markets need to pay conventional generators higher capacity prices"

Markets may, in a few situations, need to pay for capacity. That is something we already do either by direct capacity payments or very high MWh prices when those infrequently used generators are called on to produce.

" New wind/solar (at low penetration levels) may be cheaper than other NEW conventional resources, but without subsidies they are not cheaper than existing resources."

No, that is incorrect. New wind, unsubsidized, is now under 3 cents per kWh. That is cheaper than the operating costs of some paid off thermal plants. Solar, unsubsidized, is reaching 5 cents per kWh which undercuts the operating costs of some thermal plants.

"Because utility execs signing those deals don't recognize that everyone around them is doing the same thing. They will be selling their surplus wind generation at a significant loss and paying more for backup capacity."

Utility execs are signing wind and solar PPAs because they are huge bargains. Locking in electricity a <2c/kWh for 20 to 25 years is an absolute no-brainer. It's cheaper than the fuel for a CCNG. Buy RE, save fuel costs.

We're many years from any utility buying more wind and solar than they can use. When we reach that point we will probably be looking at wind and solar for about 2c/kWh. A utility could throw away (curtail) half its wind and solar and still be paying about 4c/kWh. Cheaper than some paid off thermal plants.

Overbuilding will probably become common. Cheaper to overbuild and curtail some percentage than to build storage and/or dispatchable generation.


-------

During low load months nuclear and fossil/hydro schedule PLANNED maintenance, which lowers their annual capacity factors. During the summer months the U.S. nuclear fleet typically operates at close to 98% availability and the hydro/thermal fleet at >90% availability.

Regarding spinning reserves, you have no idea what you are talking about. California ISO recently increased its regulation reserve requirement specifically due to renewable resource intermittency and forecasting error, and created a new "ramping" capacity product that will compensate conventional generators so that they can follow the net load ramp that occurs when solar falls off in the evening. ERCOT's day-ahead wind generation forecast frequently misses the mark by several thousand MWs which thermal generators cover for in the real-time market.

>>Utility execs are signing wind and solar PPAs because they are huge bargains. Locking in electricity a <2c/kWh for 20 to 25 years is an absolute no-brainer. It's cheaper than the fuel for a CCNG. Buy RE, save fuel costs.

With CCs you can actually choose when to generate. With wind overgen you are either curtailing (and losing out on your PTC payment) or selling into zero/negative prices. Again, $20/MWh isn't a bargain if you can only sell it for $0 (or could have purchased surplus wind from someone else for $0).

Wind curtailment has been an issue of inadequate transmission. Look at what has happened in ERCOT as they've built more transmission from the windy parts to the parts where people live.



![](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d4d53afb0145d060f4b3e9cbfba20e31bd5ec1196010af8a192ed77ba9f95a0b.jpg)



Grids have to have sufficient spinning reserve to cover those sorts of outages or risk cascading blackouts.

---------------
ERCOT wind curtailment is on a rapid upward trajectory since the beginning of 2016, and yes it will require more transmission to alleviate (ratepayers pick up that tab).


From mid-2015 to mid-2016 the daily average North America nuclear generation output didn't fluctuate more than 3 GW from one day to the next. Meanwhile aggregate wind generation at times fluctuated close to 20 GW from one day to the next.

Alberta set an all time electric system peak demand record earlier in December, and the roughly 20 wind farms there, with an aggregate capacity of about 1400 MW, were producing ZERO MW (that's right - zero) at the time of the new peak.

------

thermal plants also need backup and if you are going to charge wind and solar for backup then you need to charge thermal plants for backup. 


------

thermal plants need backup - 5-10% instead of 80-100%-

-------
If you have one 1 GW reactor on your grid you need spinning reserve to cover that 1 GW.

If you have lot of GW of both nuclear and coal then you could cheat back some on the amount of spinning reserve because their are few reasons why coal plants would shut down if the reactors tripped off.

Since thermal plants can and do go offline for days, weeks, months or years you need the ability to replace their generation. That's in addition to the spinning reserve you need in place for further sudden losses.

------

Yes, to account for unexpected isolated outages or extreme weather, thermal-based systems typically carry a 15%-20% planning reserve margin. A wind-based system would probably need to carry about an 80%-100% reserve margin of backup capacity (non-wind). Solar shifts the summer "net peak" into early evening hours which only reduces overall peak slightly on hot days, and so also requires a high level of backup capacity (50-80%)

-----

If you were building a new grid and wanted a GW of "always on" production here's how it might look. Let's start with some installed costs.

Wind Onshore 
$1.64 Installed Cost/Watt
DOE 2015 Wind Technologies Market Report

PV Solar
$1.17 Installed Cost/Watt
$1.30 With Tracking
Greentech Media 2nd Qtr 2016 Executive Summary

CCNG
$1.09 Installed Cost/Watt
Open EI DOE Database Median Overnight Cost

Nuclear
$6.94 Installed Cost/Watt based on Vogtle 2013 cost estimate of $15.5 billion for 2,234 MW. That price has now risen to about $9.31 billion in 2014 dollars due to further timeline overruns so now about $18.6 billion for both reactors = $8.33/Watt Installed Cost.

I'm going to use the higher number because Vogtle received some very sweet financing rates due to it starting construction during the Great Recession when money was available for extremely low rates.

So a watt of wind + a watt of solar + a watt of CCNG = $3.90. $3.9 billion for a GW of always on electricity.

And a watt of nuclear + a watt of CCNG = $9.42. $9.4 billion for a GW of always on electricity.

Financing that extra $5.5 billion is going to be a party pooper.

For a larger grid where (accepting your number) the backup for nuclear could be cut to 20% rather than 100% the cost drops to $8.55/watt or $8.6 billion for a GW. $4.6 billion more than a wind/solar/CCNG grid. More than twice as expensive.


ERCOT probably doesn't need to install more CCNG. But if they can install wind and solar which will save them fuel costs then they will benefit.

Texas is only starting to get serious about utility solar. Look for a lot of it to come online. Texas is such a sunny place that a lot of the solar can be installed close to point of use.

And Texas is apparently starting to look at coastal and offshore wind. While Texas has great wind resources up north it's more nighttime production. By adding coastal wind and solar Texas can make a lot more fuel cuts and hold down the cost of electricity. Even drop it.

Remember, the wind turbines we're putting up now may be usable for 30 to 50 years and solar farms are likely good for longer than 50 years. After the 20 year payoff that electricity gets very, very cheap. Less than $0.01/kWh.

The cost of fossil fuels will only rise with inflation and as fuel becomes more scarce. Plus those pesky external costs.

----
LCOEs are only about the cost of electricity from the source. LCOEs do not include the cost of incorporating that electricity into a grid. (ERCOT reports extremely low integration costs for wind and solar. Much cheaper than thermal plants.)

Wind and solar do need some sort of fill-in. Right now it's largely CCNG. Nuclear and coal plants also need some sort of fill-in. They do not operate 24/365. Adding a MW of CCNG to a MW of wind/solar costs the same as adding a MW of CCNG to nuclear or coal.

And, of course, we generally are not adding any fill-in for wind and solar. We just turn off existing FF generation when wind and solar are producing and save fuel costs.

"In Texas/ERCOT today, wind without subsidies does not pencil out because it crushes market prices during the very hours that wind produces at its highest levels. The same is true for solar in California."

Texas is seeing the some of the lowest increases in electricity prices among all states due to the wind generation they've brought online. That's some sweet penciling out. Holding down the cost of electricity is a good thing.

Prices go a bit lower than they would without the subsidies but that's temporary. And, don't forget, other such as coal and gas are subsidized because taxpayers pick up their external costs. The health damage cause by coal will not go away until we quit burning coal.


----
Yes, a $23/MWh wind subsidy from federal taxpayers has a way of making things pencil out for Texas ratepayers. Lower rates have also been due to low natural gas prices. However, under the hood the ERCOT market is not covering the fixed costs of merchant generators. Those generators won't operate at a loss forever, and when they start to retire you can expect a nice spike in Texas retail prices.

----
Just look at Germany and France. Germany has spent the last 15 years investing 100s of billions of Euros in solar and wind and still gets only 15% of its electricity from those sources (and that's just 3% of their total primary energy usage). No CO2 reductions for 6 years straight. And the bulk of biomass use in Europe is trees from felled forests, which are pellitized and shipped across oceans. It's renewable, but is not at all helping to avert climate change. The goal is decarbonization, not 100% renewables.

France, meanwhile has had a low-CO2 electric grid for decades. Today its grid is 95% CO2-emissions free (70% nuclear and substantial hydro plus renewables).
