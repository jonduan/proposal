##### When we say that a particular good is a commodity, what does that mean in this context?

All versions of a commodity are treated as identical as long as they pass some basic quality standards


Commodities have the same price almost everywhere - they are cheap to transport compared to the cost of creating them, and there is little or no local variation that might arise from preferences or personal tastes.



#### Why the gas price so different but not oil?

Since gas is much harder to transport than oil. Then there is no global gas market, but only local market for gas. 


oil price is globale decided since it is cheap and easy to move.

The gas price is much lower in US than in Asia.
