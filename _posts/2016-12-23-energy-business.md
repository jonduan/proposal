## Fundamentals of Global Energy Business

[Fundamentals of Global Energy Business](https://www.coursera.org/learn/energy-business). 



### Energy content

##### When we say that a particular good is a commodity, what does that mean in this context?

All versions of a commodity are treated as identical as long as they pass some basic quality standards


Commodities have the same price almost everywhere - they are cheap to transport compared to the cost of creating them, and there is little or no local variation that might arise from preferences or personal tastes.



#### Why the gas price so different but not oil?

Since gas is much harder to transport than oil. Then there is no global gas market, but only local market for gas. 


oil price is globale decided since it is cheap and easy to move.

The gas price is much lower in US than in Asia.

The coal is between two conditions.

#### Energy Prices Readings

As with energy supply and consumption, we'd like to give you a sense of the importance of energy prices in particular countries or communities. Please read these articles on the effects of low oil prices on Venezuela, and the impacts of renewable energy surcharges in Germany.

Note: these are contentious topics, with strong opinions held by different groups in each country. The opinions you see expressed here are not the only ones!

One of the first obstacles encountered involves the vagaries of electrical power generation that is dependent on sources as inconsistent and unpredictable as the wind and the sun.

And no one has invented a means of storing that energy for very long, which means overwhelming gluts on some days and crippling shortages on others that require firing up old oil- and coal-burning power plants. That, in turn, undercuts the goal of reducing fossil-fuel emissions that have been linked to climate change.
