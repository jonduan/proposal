## MITx: 12.340x Global Warming Science

[MITx: 12.340x Global Warming Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+12.340x_2+1T2016). 

What is the primary evidence used to reconstruct climates of the distant past, from many thousands to many millions of years ago?

Measurements from ice-cores and other proxies for temperature and ice-volume.

The last 2 million years of Earth's climate have been characterized by alternating cool and warm periods called glacials and interglacials respectively. The figure below shows estimates of the temperature from two ice-core proxies, and an estimate of global ice volume for the past 450 thousand years. 


#### Part I: Introduction and history of the Earth's climate > A little climate physics > Introduction to climate physics


introduce the concept of planetary energy balance, and begin to understand the properties of the Earth-system that may affect it. Specifically, the module includes the following parts:

Basic facts about the atmosphere, including its composition and vertical structure
The introduction of planetary energy balance, and how the Earth's temperature is related to solar radiation
The greenhouse effect
Developing a simple analytical model for planetary energy balance
Details of the observed radiative budget of the Earth
Observations of seasonal and other variability in the climate system


Nitrogen and Oxygen account for 78 % and 21 % of the atmoshere respectively.
