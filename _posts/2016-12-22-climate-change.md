## MITx: 12.340x Global Warming Science

[MITx: 12.340x Global Warming Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+12.340x_2+1T2016). 

What is the primary evidence used to reconstruct climates of the distant past, from many thousands to many millions of years ago?

Measurements from ice-cores and other proxies for temperature and ice-volume.

The last 2 million years of Earth's climate have been characterized by alternating cool and warm periods called glacials and interglacials respectively. The figure below shows estimates of the temperature from two ice-core proxies, and an estimate of global ice volume for the past 450 thousand years. 


##### Part I: Introduction and history of the Earth's climate > A little climate physics > Introduction to climate physics


introduce the concept of planetary energy balance, and begin to understand the properties of the Earth-system that may affect it. Specifically, the module includes the following parts:

Basic facts about the atmosphere, including its composition and vertical structure
The introduction of planetary energy balance, and how the Earth's temperature is related to solar radiation
The greenhouse effect
Developing a simple analytical model for planetary energy balance
Details of the observed radiative budget of the Earth
Observations of seasonal and other variability in the climate system


Nitrogen and Oxygen account for 78 % and 21 % of the atmoshere respectively.

Elements of Thermal Balance:
Solar Radiation
Luminosity: 3.9 x 1026 J s-­1 = 6.4 x 107 Wm-­2
at top of photosphere
Mean distance from earth: 1.5 x 1011 m
Flux density at mean radius of earth 1370 


Stefan-Boltzmann Equation:



Disposition of Solar Radiation:


Absorption per unit area


Terrestrial Radiation:

Effective emission temperature:



in the absence of the atmosphere the earth's surface temperature
would average about minus 18 degrees centigrade, which can be compared to the observed
temperature of about plus 15 degrees C.


Observed average surface temperature = 288K =15°C


The planetary energy balance represents a balance between the radiative inputs and outputs of the entire Earth system. There may be non-radiative fluxes between the individual components of the system, such as the atmosphere or solid Earth.

##### Part I: Introduction and history of the Earth's climate > A little climate physics > The greenhouse effect


The greenhouse effect is a result of the ability of the atmosphere to absorb radiation emitted by the surface (and other parts of the atmosphere) thus preventing its escape to space. In equilibrium, incoming radiation must match outgoing radiation. This equilibrium is achieved with a warmer surface temperature in the presence of the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.


that molecular oxygen and
nitrogen, which together comprise about 97% of the mass of the atmosphere are transparent to solar
and infrared radiation.


Tyndall discovered that certain trace gases interact strongly with radiation. Principally, these gases are
water vapor-- H2O, which we saw before-- is variable but on average comprises about 0.25% of the
atmosphere-- carbon dioxide, whose concentrations are measured in hundreds of parts per million--
and methane.
Fundamentally, the reason why these gases interact more strongly with radiation is that they are more
complex in their structure.


Tyndall's essential results. Oxygen and nitrogen, although they make up close to 98% of
the atmosphere, are almost entirely transparent to solar and terrestrial radiation. But water vapor,
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and a handful of other trace gases make the lower atmosphere nearly
opaque to infrared radiation, though still largely transparent to solar radiation. But clouds have a strong
effect on radiation at all wavelengths.


Atmosphere transparent to solar radiation
Atmosphere opaque to infrared radiation
Infrared emission from surface and each layer
In this model, the surface receives as much radiation from
the atmosphere as it does directly from the sun
