## Introduction:  Background Questions


Food Calories (capital-C) are equal to 1000 regular calories.

converting energy units from calorie to watt second
1 cal = 4.1868 Ws

Each calorie is 4.18 joules of energy. 600 food calories becomes 600,000 regular calories, which is 2,508,000 joules of energy. If we consume this over 600 seconds, the rate of consumption is 4,180 watts.

$$1 \ acres= 4046.856m²$$

$$\frac{10 \ acres}{1 \ year} \cdot \frac{1 \ year}{365 \ days} \cdot \frac{4046.86 \ m^2}{1 \ acre} =  110.9 \ m^2 / day$$

Humanity used 160,000 Terawatt-hours of energy in 2015. If there are 7.4 billion people on earth and 8766 hours per year, how many Watts did each person use on average?

Watts/person
$$160000 \ TW \cdot hours \cdot \frac{10^{12} \ Watts}{1 \ TW} \cdot \frac{1}{7.4 \times 10^{9} \ people \cdot 8766 \ hours }  = 2500\ Watts / person$$


Which particles have about the same mass?
 - Proton
 - Neutron

Which particles appear in equal numbers in all uncharged atoms?

 - Proton

 - Electron

Protons and neutrons are very similar in mass; electrons are about 2000 times lighter than either of them. Uncharged atoms have equal numbers of protons and electrons.

Heavier atoms generally have a greater number of neutrons than protons.

**Electric Grid Efficiency**

What is the average efficiency of electric grids in developed countries? That is, what percentage of the electrical power generated at power plants actually makes it to end users in countries like Australia, the UK, and the US?

94%



**Coal Power Efficiency**

What is the efficiency of a typical coal-fired power plant? That is, what percentage of the thermal energy from burning the coal is successfully turned into electricity?

Around 35%

**First Climate Change Treaty**


In what year did the first global treaty regarding climate change enter into force? Please answer with a number, e.g. '2016'

2015

**premature deaths from energy-related water pollution**

It's hard to estimate premature deaths from energy-related water pollution, but  it's almost certainly less than 100,000 per year, if not far less. Water pollution is a serious problem, but most mortality is from water-borne diseases causing diarrhea.


Energy-related air pollution is much worse, causing approximately **7 million** premature deaths each year. Roughly half are from indoor cooking fires (especially in Africa and Asia), and the other half are from power plants and vehicles.


Attributing deaths to climate change is difficult, but it currently causes very few deaths per year. By 2050, the World Health Organization estimates it will cause a few hundred thousand premature deaths per year.


It will only take a few days for most of the air pollution to fall out of the atmosphere and stop affecting peoples' lungs and cardiovascular systems. There is some residual mortality that would last longer.

However, carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for much longer, and the resulting temperature change will be with us for thousands of years.


**Energy costs**

In early 2016 oil prices are around \$35/barrel, and since there are ~6.1 GJ of energy in 1 barrel of oil, it costs \$5.7/GJ.

Natural gas costs \$2.5/MMBTU, which translates to \$2.5/GJ, about half the price of oil.

Coal costs only \$1.6/GJ in the US, 1/4 the price of oil, though it has the largest regional variations.

Electricity for large industrial customers is around \$.07/kWh on average, which translates to \$20/GJ, much higher than oil, and it's much higher yet in some areas with high electricity prices. Electricity for home consumers is usually significantly higher than for industrial customers, around \$.13/kWh on average, which is \$36/GJ, dramatically more expensive than oil (but more useful - electricity for a lightbulb is much more convenient than burning oil for light).

These relationships were qualitatively the same when oil and gas prices were much higher before the 2014 crash (~\$100/barrel and ~\$5/MMBTU), with the main exception being that electricity for industrial customers was comparable to the price of oil rather than being much higher.

About four fifths (80\%) of total energy appropriated by humans is from fossil fuels.

The next highest source is nuclear energy at 7\%. Fossil's portion of human energy supply has fallen slightly in recent decades (down from 90% in the 1970's) thanks to the growth of renewables.

But it is still dramatically higher than all of human history before 1850, when close to 100% human energy was from biomass.

Fossil fuels first overtook biomass (mostly trees and crops) as England's primary energy source around the year 1900, which you may find surprisingly recent.

#### energy unit

 - efficiency   

    0< efficiency <1

 - energy service
    - efficacy  liter per kilometer



The proper order is: Primary Energy (where it enters the economy), Final Energy (where it is purchased), Useful Energy (where it is used), and, last, Energy Services (the things that are done with the energy).


##### Learning Objectives

 - Be able to convert units; basic physical science conversions like BTU to joules, and conversions of quantities of fossil fuels to their energy content

 - Be able to read Sankey diagrams to understand the **flow of energy** through modern economies

 - Know the difference between primary, final, and useful energy, and energy services

 - Know the difference between energy efficiency and energy efficacy, and the ambiguities in determining how much energy is “wasted” throughout the economy

 - Be able to look up Sankey diagrams for different countries for the past several decades, and make comparisons about how much energy was used, of what kind, and for what purposes

 - Know major trends that apply in most countries, like how coal is mostly used for electricity generation and oil is mostly used for transportation

 - Know some major international trends, like the dominance of oil and gas in Middle Eastern energy systems, and the heavy reliance on traditional biomass in developing countries in Africa

 - Know which energy commodities are most commonly traded internationally, and some of the major importers and exporters

 - Be able to look up energy prices and consumption for some countries and regions

 - Be familiar with transitions of energy systems over the past 1000 years, from biomass-dominated societies to today’s fossil fuel powered economies

##### Energy Units and Conversions

**A quick note on "heating values."**  

Fossil fuels contain some water, and whenever they're combusted some of the released energy is used to turn that water into steam (and thus isn't available to power an engine or generator).  

Advanced combustion systems can capture that steam and condense it back to water, capturing the lost energy and getting close to 100% of the available energy from combustion.  

Simpler combustion systems don't do this, and thus lose ~5-10% of the available energy.  

So when listing the heat of combustion for fossil fuels (amount of energy released from combustion), most sources will list a "lower heating value" for simple systems without condensers, and "higher heating values" for systems with condensers.  

In this course we generally use HHV's, since most power plants and large industrial energy infrastructure use condensers (and they're even becoming common on home furnaces).

**Gas vs. Coal**

In the US in 2016, coal costs \$1.6/MMBTU (1 MMBTU = 1,000,000 BTU) and gas costs \$.2/therm. Which is cheaper?

Coal is cheaper. It costs = \$1.5/GJ, while gas costs = \$1.9/GJ.


$$\frac{$1.6}{1 \ MMBTU} \cdot \frac{0.947817 \ MMBTU}{1 \ GJ} = $1.51 \ per \ GJ$$


$$\frac{$0.2}{1 \ therm} \cdot \frac{9.48043 \ therms}{1 \ GJ} = $1.90 \ per \ GJ$$


**Electricity vs. natural gas**

Electricity costs \$.2/kWh and natural gas costs \$12/MMBTU for residential consumers in Massachusetts, where David and Daniel live.

Which is cheaper on an energy basis?

Gas is cheaper. It costs = \$11/GJ, while electricity costs = \$56/GJ.


$$\frac{$0.2}{1 \ kWh} \cdot \frac{277.778 \ kWh}{1 \ GJ} = $56 \ per \ GJ$$



$$\frac{$12}{1 \ MMBTU} \cdot \frac{0.947817 \ MMBTU}{1 \ GJ} = $11 \ per \ GJ$$



The International Energy Agency says Russia used ~60,000 PJ (Petajoules) of primary energy in 2013.

The Energy Information Administration says the US used 98 Quadrillion BTU of primary energy in that same year. Which country used more energy?


The US did. Russia used 60 Exajoules; the US used 103 Exajoules.

$$60,000 \ PJ \cdot \frac{1 \ EJ}{1000 \ PJ} = 60 EJ$$




$$1 MMBTU = 1,000,000 BTU$$

$$EJ = 1,000PJ = 1000,000TJ =  1000,000,000GJ$$
 - Exajoules
 - Petajoules
 - gigajoule

In 2013 the US consumed 840 million metric tons of coal, and used 103 EJ of energy overall. What fraction of the total US primary energy supply was from coal?


$$840 \times 10^6 \ tons \ coal \cdot \frac{27.5 \ GJ}{1 \ ton} \cdot \frac{1 \ EJ}{10^9 \ GJ} = 23 \ EJ$$


$$\frac{23}{103} = 22\% $$


**Tesla Model S vs standard car**

The Tesla Model S has an 85 kWh battery; a standard car has a 60 liter gas tank. How many times as much energy can the standard car’s gas tank hold than the Tesla’s battery?

$$60 \ liters \cdot \frac{9.75 \ kWh}{1 \ liter}  = 585 \ kWh$$

Since the battery holds 85 kWh, the gas tank holds $$(585 / 85) = 6.88$$ times as much energy as the battery.

$$0.035*278 = 9.73$$
