##Tidal energy

Tidal energy is a small contributor of the world energy mix but can be a very sustainable power source at places with a high tidal height difference.

How does a tidal power station work? What is the power density of tidal energy and what are the pros and cons?


##### Tidal Energy in India

Let's make a plan to construct tidal pools in front of the coastline of India. The figure below shows the map of the averaged tidal heights around the world. 
The total area of the pools is 10000 km2.
The population of India is 1241 million
Land Area is 3287590 km2
Electricity generation: 835 TWh/year
Assume a gravitational constant of 10 m/s2
Assume a water density of 1000 kg/m3

Excluding south tip of the country tidal heigh is between 30-70 cm average is 50 cm


E=m*g*H = mass * 10 (m/s^2) * 0,5 (m)
mass/m^2= rho*H =1000 (kg/m^3) * 0,5 (m)
2 times per day
E per day= 2* 1000 (kg/m^3)*10 (m/s^2) * 0.5^2 (m^2) =5000 J/m^2/day




How much electricity expressed in KWh/person/day can be generated using pools with the above indicated area?



E per day per m2= 2*1000*10*0.5^2=5000 J/m^2/day
E in kWh per area = 5000/3600/1000=0.001388 Kwh/m^2/day
E per day = E/A * A = 0.001388 * 10,000*10^6 = 13.88 *10^6 kWh/day
E per person per day = 13.88 *10^6 (kWh/day) / 1241*10^6 (persons) = 0.0112 kWh/person/day
