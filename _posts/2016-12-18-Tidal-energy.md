##Tidal energy

Tidal energy is a small contributor of the world energy mix but can be a very sustainable power source at places with a high tidal height difference.

How does a tidal power station work? What is the power density of tidal energy and what are the pros and cons?


##### Tidal Energy in India

Let's make a plan to construct tidal pools in front of the coastline of India. The figure below shows the map of the averaged tidal heights around the world. 
The total area of the pools is 10000 km2.
The population of India is 1241 million
Land Area is 3287590 km2
Electricity generation: 835 TWh/year
Assume a gravitational constant of 10 m/s2
Assume a water density of 1000 kg/m3

Excluding south tip of the country tidal heigh is between 30-70 cm average is 50 cm


E=m*g*H = mass * 10 (m/s^2) * 0,5 (m)
mass/m^2= rho*H =1000 (kg/m^3) * 0,5 (m)
2 times per day
E per day= 2* 1000 (kg/m^3)*10 (m/s^2) * 0.5^2 (m^2) =5000 J/m^2/day




How much electricity expressed in KWh/person/day can be generated using pools with the above indicated area?



E per day per m2= 2*1000*10*0.5^2=5000 J/m^2/day
E in kWh per area = 5000/3600/1000=0.001388 Kwh/m^2/day
E per day = E/A * A = 0.001388 * 10,000*10^6 = 13.88 *10^6 kWh/day
E per person per day = 13.88 *10^6 (kWh/day) / 1241*10^6 (persons) = 0.0112 kWh/person/day

What is the the contribution expressed in percentage of tidal pools to the total electricity generation in India? 

E = 13.88 *10^6 (kWh/day) *365 (days) = 5.0662 10^9 (kWh/year) = 5.0662 Twh/year
% = 5.0662 (TWh) / 835 (TWh) * 100% = 0.607%


## Renewable Energy Generation > 2.7 Ocean Current and Wave Energy 


The ocean is a giant source of energy. Although it is mainly in the experimental phase wave and ocean current energy can contribute a substantial part of the sustainable energy mix.

How much can an underwater turbine produce and what is the power potential?


### The power in waves

To calculate the power in waves we will only consider the deep-water waves. These waves can be modeled with a wavelength λ and amplitude of h as indicated in the figure below. Waves are caused mainly by wind. The wavelength λ and period T depend on the speed of the wind. The height, h of the wave crest depends on the duration of a certain wind speed. 

The energy in a wave consists of Potential energy because the water moves up and down by the wave. It also contains a kinetic energy part because the water molecules move in a circular motion shown by the arrows in the figure.
