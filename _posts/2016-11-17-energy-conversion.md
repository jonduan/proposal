# BACKGROUND


## 1.1 Measuring Energy
#### Barrel of oil

A barrel of oil contains the energy equivalent of $5.8 \cdot 10^6$ Btu.
6119 MJ



1 Btu is equal to 1055 J.

1 MJ is equal to 1 000 000 J.

#### Cube of sugar

A cube of sugar has 9 kcal.
38 kJ


1 kcal is equal to 4184 J.

1 kJ is equal to 1 000 J.  


#### Tesla battery

A Tesla battery has a 60 kWh capacity.
 216 MJ

1 kWh is equal to 3.6 MJ.


## 1.2 Energy conversion
### The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.

This is demonstrated in any type of energy conversion system. Let's consider the following system: a solar module converts solar energy to heat and electricity. The electricity is used to charge the battery of a laptop. This electricity is stored as chemical energy and some is lost as heat. This is shown in the following diagram.

electricity will be lost as heat, and therefore, has to be larger than the chemical energy that can be stored in the battery.

## 1.3 Energy Carriers

An energy carrier is a substance or a phenomenon that contains energy.

This energy can then be converted to mechanical work or heat, or used to operate chemical or physical processes. We will further study some energy carriers in the following video.

All renewable energy systems are able to transform different types of energy available on earth into electricity or heat for further use.

For the following renewable energy systems, hydroelectricity and concentrated solar power, choose the type of energy that best suits the energy converted for each step of the renewable energy system.

Hydropower starts with a water reservoir that has potential energy. This is driven through a turbine, converting it into mechanical energy, to generate electricity.

Concentrated solar power uses the incident energy on Earth from the sun, so electromagnetic energy, and heats up a working fluid, so it is converted into thermal energy. Then this vapor is used to move a turbine (mechanical energy) to generate electricity.

The Ragone chart presented here shows the peak power density against the energy density of various energy carriers. Note, that we have two logarithmic axis, so that different storage properties can be compared in one graph. Gasoline has a high energy density and a relatively high power density, while batteries have lower energy densities.

Hydrogen, an energy carrier mentioned in the previous video, has a high energy density, but a low power density.

Identify the energy carriers in the following graph

  - Hydrogen combustion  #1

  - Lithium-ion battery   #2

  - Gasoline  #3
