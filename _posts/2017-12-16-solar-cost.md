## Solar energy cost

[Maoneng lands Australia’s biggest solar PPA – 300MW – with AGL](http://reneweconomy.com.au/maoneng-lands-australias-biggest-solar-ppa-300mw-with-agl-26682/). 


Maoneng said it had signed a 15-year PPA with AGL for 800,000MWh of renewable energy per year – the equivalent of a 300MW solar PV plant.


The price for the PPA was not revealed – as is typical in Australia – but it comes as part of package, with a total cost of $76/MWh that includes an upgrade to the Bayswater coal plant, a new 250MW gas peaking plant (expensive), and 25MW of demand response.
