## Geothermal


Geothermal is being used more and more as it can provide a baseload to the electricity grid.

How much electricity can a geothermal power station provide? What is the power density of geothermal energy and what are the pros and cons?


### Geothermal system for greenhouses in the Netherlands

In the lecture we showed you an average heat flux through the earth of 50 mW/m2. This is mainly caused by radioactive decay of the earth crust and partly by heat leaking from the earth core. The latter can be more substantial in places like Iceland that are situated on top of fault lines. Geothermal energy often doesn't go through the entire mantle of the earth and can be 'trapped' inside rock formations in so called heat reservoirs.  In this exercise we will try to calculate what the power density of such a reservoir is. 

The Westland area in the Netherlands is known for its horticulture. One of the horticulture companies situated in The Westland has recently installed a geothermal system to provide heat for its 47 hectares of greenhouses. It is situated on top of sandstone which is very suitable for geothermal power generation because it is very permeable. The company uses heat that is stored in a heat reservoir in the sandstone 2500 meters under the ground.
