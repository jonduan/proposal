\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}


The goal of the current research is to understand the economic
consequences of integrating renewable energy into existing power
systems, design policies to achieve an optimal mix of generating assets
in an electricity grid, and determine the costs and benefits of using
renewable energy sources to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gas (hereafter just CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions.
