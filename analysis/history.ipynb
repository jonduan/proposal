Customers (commercial and residential), through the AESO, pay the owners of the transmission systems (Transmission Facility Owners or TFOs) their capital and operating costs, plus a reasonable rate of return."

    "The SCC is also home to the Energy Trading System. The wholesale electricity market in Alberta operates much like a stock exchange, matching offers from market participants who wish to sell electricity with bids from market participants who wish to buy it. A market participant is any organization who generates, buys or sells, transmits, distributes, trades, imports or exports electricity in the Alberta market.\n",

    "Market participants who wish to buy or sell electricity submit several supply offers and demand bids to the market on a day-ahead basis for every hour, 24 hours a day\n",
    "\n",
    "These supply offers and demand bids are sorted from the lowest to highest price for each hour of the day into a list called a merit order. System Controllers use the merit order to balance the supply of electricity, starting at the lowest priced supply offers and moving up to the highest. In this way, the AESO ensures Albertaâ€™s overall electricity needs are met by the most competitively priced electricity.\n",

    "Typically, the demand for electricity is higher in the morning as Albertans prepare to start their day and declines slightly to a steady level throughout the day. A second increase occurs in the early evening hours as Albertans return home from work or school and place more demand for electricity on the system using home appliances and street lighting. Demand then decreases throughout the night. It shifts with the seasons as well; cold weather increases the demand for electricity required to run heaters, furnaces and lighting, and hot weather increases the demand from air conditioning and refrigeration.\n",

    "We defined the System Marginal Price (SMP) as the generator bid that clears the market, and assumed that sellers are paid the SMP, while buyers pay the SMP. In fact, sellers at a node are paid a price called Locational Marginal Price (LMP), while buyers pay the LMP at their node. Formally, the LMP at node k in the network is defined as the marginal cost of delivering an incremental unit of energy (one additional MW) to node k in the network. If there is no congestion in the network, and there are no transmission losses, LMPs at all nodes are identical and equal to the SMP.\n",
