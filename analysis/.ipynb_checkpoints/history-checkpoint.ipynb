    "We defined the System Marginal Price (SMP) as the generator bid that clears the market, and assumed that sellers are paid the SMP, while buyers pay the SMP. In fact, sellers at a node are paid a price called Locational Marginal Price (LMP), while buyers pay the LMP at their node. Formally, the LMP at node k in the network is defined as the marginal cost of delivering an incremental unit of energy (one additional MW) to node k in the network. If there is no congestion in the network, and there are no transmission losses, LMPs at all nodes are identical and equal to the SMP.\n",
